"Aboriginal  Tradition.                     About  six  miles  from  Portland  (Vic.)  there  are  a  number  of  beautiful  caves.  In  connection  with  one  of  them  there  is  a  strange  tradition  among  the  blacks  of  the  district.  A  few  years  ago  a  petrified  animal  was  found  lying  among  a  mass  of  stalagmites.  This   was  said  to  be  a  lion,  which  had  flourished  in  the  locality  nearly  a  century  ago.  According  to  the  story  related,  a  vessel  arrived  near  the  spot  where  Portland  now  stands,  and  the  captain  sent  ashore  his  first  mate  and  a  boat  load  of  seamen  to  obtain  water.  While  so  engaged,  the  aboriginals  attacked  the  party  and  speared  the  mate,  who  subsequently  died  from  his  wounds,  and  was  buried  at  sea.  Not  having  sufficient  men  or  arms  at  his  disposal  to  send  a  punitive  expedition  after  the  blacks,  the  captain  sailed  away,  but  still  carrying  with  him  the  idea  of  one  day  retaliating  on  the  murderers.  A  year  later  he  visited  South  Africa,  and  there  purchased  a  lion.  On  his  next  trip  to  Australia  he  went  out  of  his  way  to  visit  Portland,  and  sending  the  lion  ashore  in  a  cage,  there  released  it.  The  animal  lived  for  some  years,  killing  and  eating  a  number  of  blacks,  and  at  last  succumb-  ing  to  old  age  in  the  cave  where  its  petrified  body  was  discovered.",107196484,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/107196484,Aboriginal Tradition.,Article,1906-11-09,3,3,ABOUT six miles from Portland (Vic.) there are a number of beautiful caves.

"ABO&HHNAL  NAMES.   There  is  the  authority  of  Pope,  that  'little  hook  backed  creature,'  for  remarking  that  'the  proper  study  of  mankind  is  man.'  It  is  a  pleasant  study,  and  a  profitable,  and  he  who  pursues  it  with  assiduity  and  zest  both  benefits  himself  and,  if  he  give  forth  his  knowledge  to  the  world,  his  fellowmen.  The  observance  of  characteristic  fellow-men.  The  observance  of  characteristic  is  no  less  fraught  with  interest  to  the  anthropo  logical  student  than  the  study  of  the  traits,  intel  lectual  endowments,  and  moral  worth  of  the   Great.  But  because  the  great  and  distinguished  live  always  in  the  fierce  glare  of  the  light  of  fame,  iheir  ways  and  methods  commend  themselves  most  readily  to  the  observatory  appetite.  Now,  take  the  case  of  Mr.  O'Sullivan,  whose  name  is  not  unfamiliar  to  readers  of  these  columns.  From  time  to  time  it  has  been  the  pleasing  duty  of  the  press  to  chronicle  the  many  embryonic  achieve  ments,  in  the  paths  of  science  and  the  arts,  with  which  the  fertile  brain  of  the  Minister  for  Works  is  full.  The  High  Ideal  has  ever  been  his  mo  tive.  It  is  only  necessary  to  mention  'Australia  Facing  the  Dawn,'  Lyne  Park,  the  romantic  tram  shed  on  the  site  of  Fort  Macquarie,  the  pointed  white  thing  which  stands  in.  Queen's  Square,  the  new  railway  station,  the  Pitt-street  tram,  the  fer  tile  farm  amongst  the  Randwick  eand  hills  —  just  a  few  of  many  deeds  accomplished,  incomplete,  or  shelved  —  to  remind  our  readers  of  the  infinity  of  intellectual  parts,  whose  benefit,  by  the  mercy  of  Fate,  we  enjoy  in  the  possession  of  Mr.  O'Sulli  van.  He  has  triumphed  in  art  and  architecture,  and  now  he  is  about  to  triumph  in  what  may  be  termed,  so  far  as  Australia  is  concerned,  archaic  philology.  By  his  direction,  an  officer  of  the  Harbors  and  Rivers  Department  has  prepared  a  list  of  aboriginal  names  of  localities,  with  their  meanings,  in  order  to  provide  a  kind  of  christen  ing-dictionary  for  the  new  vessels  which  may  be  added  from  time  to  time  to  the  already  large  fleet  owned  by  the  State.  It  is  a  very  lengthy  list,  however,  and  much    as  such  a  thing  is  to  be  de  sired,  there  can  hardly  be  likelihood  of  Mr.  O'Sul  livan's  remaining  in  office  for  a  sufficiently  long  term  to  buy  or  build  enough  vessels  on  which  to  use  it  all  up.  At  10  o'clock  to-day  a  be  ginning  was  made  of  the  new  series  by  the  launch  of  the  'Yimmang.'  The  'Burunda'  and  the  'Wollomba'  will  also  be  named  shortly.  It  is  a  pretty  list,  and,  no  doubt,  Mr.  O'Sullivan  will  succeed  in  considerably  enriching  the  litera  ture  of  the  harbors  and  rivers  before  the  time  comes  for  his  departure  from  the  helm  of  the  Works  Department.  But,  glancing  casually  over  the  names  selected,  there  are  two  against  the  employment  of  which  it  is  only  friendly  to  warn.  Mr.  O'Sullivan.  'Yoolaugh'  (the  name  of  'file  land  where  our  Botanic  Gardens  are  situated)  might  be  taken  to  imply  that  tbe  beholder  of  a  possible  vessel  so  named  would  be  moved  to  mirth  at  the  expense  of  the  Minister  who  so  named  her  and  'Minyago  Yugilla'  (why  weepest  thou?)  would  perhaps  suggest  that  his  schemes  for  beautifying  all  things  moved  the  taxpayer  to  tears,  rather  than  that  they  inclined  him  to  hap  piness  in  the  paying  for.",113870079,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/113870079,ABORIGINAL NAMES.,Article,1902-01-11,4,4,"There is the authority of Pope, that ""little hook-backed creature,"" for remarking that ""the proper study of mankind is man.""

"ABORIGINAL  MURDERS.   IT  is  long  since  the  public  mind  has  been  so  stirred  as  it  has  been  this  week  by  the  recital  of  the  terrible  murders  which  took  place  near  Gilgandra  on  Friday  night  last.  The  remnants  of  aboriginal  tribes  are  so  frequently  to  be  met  with  in  the  country  districts  throughout  this  colony,  and  the  individuals  comprising  them  have  generally  borne  such  an  inoffensive  character,  that  a  murderous  outbreak  such  as  that  reported  from  Breelong,  has  spread  a  feeling  of  consternation  and  alarm  among  white  settlers  living  in  remote  and  isolated  localities  where  the  presence  of  a  black's  camp  is  looked  upon  as  having  no  particular  element  of  danger  about  it.  But  the  character  of  the  black  savage  has  not  changed  even  when  brought  under  the  influence  of  a  bush  civilization,  and  it  only  requires  the  opportunity  for  him  to  develop  and  carry  into  execution  the  worst  and  vilest  instincts  of  his  nature.  So  far  as-we  can  learn  from  the  evidence  there  seems  to  have  been  no  personal  feeling  of  ill-will  between  the  murderers  and  their  victims.  Mr.  Mawbey,  whose  home  has  been  so  terribly  desolated  by  this  outrage,  was  a  settler  in  comfortable  circumstances  and  the  owner  or  occupier  of  several  thousand  'acres  of  land.  With  his  sons  he  appears  to'have  worked  his  little  estate,  employing  casual  labour  when  he  required  it.  For  several  months  past,  about  three  miles  from  the  Mawbey  homestead,  some  four  or  five  adult  blacks  and  half-castes,  with  a  white  woman  and  several,  children,  have  had,their  camp  in  the  usual  blackfellow  fashion.  The  woman,  or  rather  a  girl  eighteen  years  of  age,  has  stated  that  she  was  legally  married  to  one  of  the  blackfellows  and  that  she  Jived  with,  her  husband  in  the  black's  camp,  Souie  of  the*  men  had  taken  a  fencing  contract  from  Mawbey,  and  with  the  exception  that  on  one  occasion  when  a  small  lot  of  posts*were  rejected  there  seems  to  have  been  no  cause  of'  disagreement  be-  -  tween  the  parties.  The  men  were  earning  good  wages  and  were  in  the  habit  of  keeping  their,  camp  well  supplied  with  rations.  An  hour  or  «o  before  'the  .'outbreak  the  woman  and  her  husband  had  some  words,  the  latter  accusing  his  wife.of-being  '!-SKeet  ""  on  another-blackfellow.  On  Friday  nigbt  Mawbey  and  one  or  two  'of  his  elder,  sons  were  sleeping  some  three  quarters  of  a  mile  away  :  from  the  house  occupied  by  Mrs.  Mawbey  .and  .the  other  chUdrpo,  most  of  whom  werfe  gttfs,  ""together  w'jth""  a  young  woman  whose  occupation  was  that  of  a  school  teacher..  About  II  o'clock.at  night  Mawbey  and  his  sons,  who  were  in  bed,  were  visited  by  the'blacks,  but  after  inquiries  about  some  flour  that  was  to  be  given  them  next  day  the  men  left.  Little  did  the  father  anticipate  the  trouble  i<liat  was  brewing,  for  the  miscreants  had  been  gone  iiarely.  half  an  hour  when  one  of  Ijfs  younger.?  children  came  U>  him  telling  hiinthafc&he  blacka  bajd  commenced  tbeir  mui'derousWorli.'  .

From  some  mitigating  circumstances  connccted  with  the  case,  she  was  not  convicted  of  the  capital  offence,,  and  regained  her  liberty  after  some  two  years  confinement  in  Bathurst  gaol.  ""  JACKET  JACKET.""  About  26  years  ago  a  sad  tragedy  was  enacted  some  18  or  17  miles  from  Forbes  oil  the  Bo'gan  road.  Mra.  Howell,  an  elderly  woman  who  resided  with  her  husband  at  Burra  Burra  some  65  or  70  miles  distant,  lial  been  in  town  purchasing  supplies  for  the  station.  Her  eon,  with  a  youth  named  Pulbrook,  had  previously  been  sent  to  Forbes  with  a  team.  After  completing  her  purchases  and  seeing  the  team  loaded  and  started  for  home,  Mrs.  Howell  (who  was  driving  alone  in  a  buggy)  stayed  in  town  for  the  night  and  started  on  her  return  journey  the  next  morning,  expecting  to  overtake  hereon  at  his  first  camp.  Willi  young  Howell  and  Pulbrook  was  a  Queensland  black  whom  they  had  brought  with  them  from  Burra  Burra  to  look  after  the  horses.  On  driving  up  to  the  camp  Mrs.  Howell's  first  thought  was  that  the  boys  had  overslept  themselves,  as  the  dray  had  the  tarpaulin  drawn  all  over  it,  the  horses  were  not  in  sight,  nor  was  there  any  sign  of  a  fire.  On  coming  up  a  little  closer  she  saw  a  naked  foot  showing  under  the  dray  covering,  aud  oti  getting  down  and  lifting  a  corner  of  it  she  was  horrified  at  seeing  the  dead  bodies  of  her  son  and  young  Pulbrook  who  had  evidently  been  cruelly  murdered  in  tbeir  sleep.  Her  suspicions  fell  at  once  on  ""  .lackey  Jackey  ""  the  Queensland  myall  as  the  culprit,  and  as  he  was  nowhere  within  sight  or  hearing  she  drove  hack  to  towi  1  •  in  &  condition  more  dead  than  alive,  to  give  info  mation  to  the  police.  Inspector  Stephenson  who  was  then  in  charge  here,  with  e.  couple  of  mounted  men,  Pye  and  Caban,  and  accompanied  by  one  of  the  best  black-trackers  in  the  lacblan  and  Bogan  districts,  started  in  pursuit  of  the  missing  myall.  The  chase  proved  a  lone  and  tedious  one.  ""  Jackey  ""  lad  bec.n  seen  riding  a  white  horse  b-.longing  to  the  Howell's,  and  he  was  evidently  bent  on  crossing  into  Queensland  as  speedily  as  possible.  He  was  ultimately  taken  near  where  the  town  of  Bourke  now  stands',  and  the  story  of  his  capuiire  as  related  by  the  police  engaged,  in  it  showed  both  his  cunning  and  agility  in  a  marked  degree.  When  first  sighted  by  the  troopers  in  the  bush  some  hundreds  of  miles  from  Forbes  he  was  on  foot,  and  showed  a  inost  determined  opposition  to  being  taken.  He  was  clad  iu  a  shirt  and  trousers,  both  tattered  and  in  vags,  and  was  armed  with  only  a  tomahawk,  but  a  terrible  weapon  iu  the  hand's  .of  an  enraged  and  determined  blackfellow.  For  a  long  time  he  defied  capture,  and  the  police  were  anxious  to  take  liim  without  coining  to  blows.  ""  Jackcy  ""  stood  with  his  back  to  a  tree,  and  on  anyone  approaching  he  sliied  sticks  at  them  with  unerring  accuracy,  some  of  the  men  being  hit  rather  severely.  The  tomahawk  was  reserved  for  the  final  struggle,  when  the  black  was  determined  to  sell  his  life  or  his  liberty  as  dearly  as  possible.  When  the  stick  ammunition  gave  out,  at  a  concerted  signal  ""  Jackey's  ""  attention  was  directed  to  a  given  point,  when  a  rush  was  made  by  one  of  the  police.  It  wr.d  a  case  of  ""do  or  die""  between  both  biack  and  white  men,  and  in  an  instant  ""  Jackey  ""  was  disarmed  and  his  unstained  weapon  secured  ""by  a  trooper.  The  return  journey  to  Forbes  was  uneventful  save  for  one  incident.  The  police  and  their  prisoner  had  got  as  far  as  Phillips'  station  on  the  Bogan  where  they  intended  staying  the  night.  They  were  allowed  the  use  of  a  large  bush  kitchen  in  which  they  were  to  sleep  after  partaking  of  supper.  Then  they  all  lay  down  in  t  heir  blankets,  ""  Jackey  ""  of  course  heavily  ironed.  The  day's  ride  had  been  long,and  tedious,  and  men  and  horses  were  nearly  worn  out.  In  the  middle  of  the  night  the  officer  who  was  supposed  to  have  ""Jackey""  in  hiaspecial  charge  missed  him.  He  was  nowhere  on  the  floor  with  the  others,  and  at  once  the  alarm  was  given.  Soon  every  mail  was  on  his  feel,  and  iust  then  one  of  the  party  espied  ""  Jaekcy's  ""  legs,  while  his  body  was  half  way  up  the  chimney.  Another  minute  and  the  myall  would  had  given  them  leg-bail  for  it.  The  remainder  of  the  journey  was  coinpleted  in  safety,  and  when  Stephenson  rode  with  his  captive  to  the  lock-up  across  the  square  (it  was  not  fenced  then),  hundreds  of  people  crowded  round  cheering  the  police  and  staring  their  hardest  at  poor  ""  Jackey.""

At  3  in  the  morning  the  mate  wakened  him  with  the  intelligence  that  a  faint  light  had  become  visible  right  ahead.

I  saw  several  of  the  graves,  and  when  newly  made  they  looked  like  ant-hills.  I  was  told  the  practice  was  to  make  a  round  hole  in  the  ground,  and  to  place  the  corpse  in  this  in  a  kneeling  position  then  the  soil  was  filled  in  and  heaped  up  over  the  head  of  the  ""departed,""  a  cone-shaped  mound  being  then  formed.  From  Goondiwindi  to  Boolarwell  and  on  to  the  other  side  of  St.  George  they  used  to  drop  the  dead  bodies  into  hollow  trees.  If  the  tree  was  a  good  one  for  the  pur-  pose,  they  kept  on  using  it  until  the  hollow  was  quite  full  of  mummified  bodies.

"ABORIGINAL  SONGS.   The  Tasmanlan  aborigines  were  practically  exterminated  before  eth  nology  became  science,  consequently  very  iittle  is  known  of  their  ways  or  language  before  they  came  In  contact  with  Europeans.  Several  writers,  however,  have  left  vocabularies  and  songs  on  record,  but  these  differ  such  on  extent  as  to  lead  to  the  belief  that  many  different  dialects  were  in  use.  Professor  Herman  Ritz,  who  has  recently  undertaken  a  systematic  study  of  the  language,  read  a  very  interesting  paper  at  the  Royal  Society  on  Monday  night,  in  which  he  argued  that  the  differences  were  due  to  mistakes,  or  different  methods  ot  spelling  what  were  really  the  same  words.  He  quoted  as  an  instance  a  song  which  seems  to  have  been  common  to  all  the  native  tribes,  and  which  Is  recorded  in  different  fashion  by  three  writers,  Messrs.  Milligan,  Davies,  and  Walker.  Milligan's  version  was   Pappela.  Rayna  ngonyna,  Pappela  Rayna  ngonyna,  Pappela  Rayna  ngonyna!  Toka  mengha  leah,  Toka  mengha  leah  Toka  mengha  leah  !  Lugha  mcngha  Leah  !  Lugha  mengha  leah,  Lugha  mengha  Leah  !

Ncna  nawra  pcwyllah,  Pallah  nawra  pewyllah  !  Pollawah,  Pellawah  !  That  of  Davies  was  as  follows:.  Ne  popila  raina  pogana.  (Every  line  is  repeated  three  times.)  Thu  me  gunnea  Thoga  me  gunnea,  Naina  thaipa  raina  pogana,  Naara  paara  poivella  paara,  Ballahoo,  Ballahoo,  Hoo,  Hoo!  The  version  given  by  Walker  was:  Poppyla  renung-onnyna,  poppyla  Poppyla,  etc.      Temingannya  -  lemingannya  -  leming,  Taukummingannya,  Taukummlngannya,  Nyna  tepe  rena  ponnyna,  nyna  etc..  Nyna,  etc  Nyna  nara  pewilly  para,  Nyna  etc.,      Nyna  etc.  Nara  pewiily  pallawoo,  pallawoo  !  Nyna  nara  pewillly  para,  nara  pewilliy    pallawoo  !  pallawoo  !  Nyna  nara,  etc.,  Nyna  nara,  etc.,  etc.   ""Piovella,""  in  the  second  version,  Mr.  Ritz  said,  was  a  very  palpable  misprint  for  ""powella,  as  shown  by  the  context.  He  regarded  this  song  in  the  light  of  a  Rosetta  stone,  alluding  to  the  famous  stone  which  was  found  in  Egypt,  bearing  inscriptions  in  three  languages,  which  enabled  Champollion  to  decipher  the  Egyptian  hlerogl}'-  pbics.  When  the  three  versions,  were  reduced  to  their  fundamental  sounds  it  became  apparent  that  they  were  all  practically  one  and  the  same  thing.  The  word  grouping,  which  bore  some  analogy  to  the  Chinese,  was  the  same  in  each  case.  When  rendered  into  English  the  translation  of  the  first  sion  was:  ""Miighty  runs  the  bushfire.  My  heel,  too,  is  speedy  and  my  foot  is  swift.  Come  thou,  and  run  with  the  speed  of  a  bird.  Thou  art  a  real  warrior,  a  man  indeed  warrior,  hero.""  The  second  version  ran:  ""Lo,  with  might  runs  a  man.  My  heel  is  swift  like  fire.  Come  thou  and  run  like  a  man,  a  very  man,  a  great  man,  a  man  who  is  a  hero,  hurrah.""  The  third  version,  as  given  by  Walker,  appeared  to  he  a  combination  of  the  other  two.  It  meant:  ""With  might  runs  the  fire.  My  heel  is  like  fire.  My  foot  is  like  fire.  Come  thou  and  run  like  a  bird,  a  great  man,  a  hero,  hurrah.""  The  main  wants  of  the  natives,  Mr.  Ritz  said,  would  in  all  probability  have  been  food  and  security  In  which  to  eat  it,  and  the  greatest  man  amongst  them  would  therefore  have  been  tbe  best  hunter  and  warrior.

"ABORIGINAL  DOMESTICS.   The  demand  for  girls  as  domestic  servants  still  continues,  and  the  reports  from  the  mistresses  of  the  girls'  behaviour  are  generally  good.  The  Protectress  re-   port  as  follows  :—  The  number  of  girls  in  service  on  December  31,  1907,  was  as  follows:—116  half-castes  and  70  full-bloods.  The  amount  standing  to  their  credit  on  that  date  was  £1002  ?_.  4d.,  the  number  of  banking  accounts  being  188,  consisting  of  186  accounts  for  girls  in  service,  and  two  trust  accounts  for  half-caste  infants.  The  wages  received  by  the  girls  vary  in  amount  from  Is.  3d.  per  week  and  clothing  to  15s.  per  week.  Pocket  money  is  allowed  to  the  girls  according  to  the  rate  of  wages  earned,  from  3d.  per  week  to  4s.,  the  balance  of  the  wages  being  paid  to  the  Protector,  who  banks  the  amount  to  the  girls  credit  in  the  Government  Sav-  ings  Bank,  and  withdrawals  are  made  from  the  Savings  Bank  accounts  for  clothing  and  cash  advances  to  the  girls.  To  show  the  necessity  of  all  cash  advances  and  purchase  of  clothing  being  made  by  the  Protectress,  it  is  only  necessary  to  state  that  trouble  is  now  and  then  experienced  with  some  mistresses,  who,  instead  of  en   couraging  the  girls  in  thrift,  encourage  them  to  waste  their  hard-earned  money  on  clothes  far  above  their  station  in  life,  such  as  a  costume  at  £3  3s.  and  a  hat  £1  5s.  The  general  behaviour  of  the  girls  is  good,  and  an  improvement  exists  In  the  way  in  which  the  mistresses  now  treat  them,  though,  in  one  or  two  cases,  the  girls  had  to  he  removed  on,  account  of  ill-treatment  by  their  employers.  Hap  pily,  these  cases  are  becoming  very  scarce,  and  employers  are  beginning  to  realise  that  better  results  can  be  obtained  from  the  girls  by  treating  them  with  kindness.  Complaints  are  now  and  then  made  by  the  mistresses  re  the  girls'  dis  inclination  for  work,  but,  when  these  com  plaints  are  investigated,  it  generally  turns  out  that  the  girls  are  expected  to  work  from  sunrise  till  10  and  11  o'clock  at  night,  and  even  the  strongest  of  girls,  physically,  cannot  stand  the  continuous  strain  of  hard  work.  In  cases  where  the  mistress  refuses  to  sign  the  necessary  agreement,  drastic  measures  have  to  be  taken,  and  the  girl  removed,  and  placed  with  a  mistress  who  will  obey  the  regulations.  Taken  on  a  whole,  the  girls  give  satisfaction  as  servants,  but  they  require  tactful  handling.  They  have  also  a  strong  tendency  ""towards  extravagance,  which  has  to  be  checked,  with  a  view  of  encouraging  providence  aniongst  them.  The  appearance  of  the  girls  speaks  for  itself,  as  they  are  very  clean  in  both  their  persons  and  wearing  apparel.  I  have  found  the  girls,  on  the  whole,  fairly  amenable  to  discipline.  Two  of  them  died  last  year,  and  I  have  also  to  record  the  birth  of  three  illegitimate  quadroon  children.

Oh,  yes,  I  was  going  to  say  in  plain  English—  which  often  is  so  very  confusing,  isn't  it?—  I  was  go-  ing  to  say  in  plain-confused  English  that  I've  just  come  back  from  a  trip  to  the  Never-Never  country,  where  I  saw  our  Australian  aborigines  in  all  their  splendid  grace  and  vivacity,  un-  spoilt  by  civilization.  Wonderful  place,  the  Never-Never  country!  That's  the  place  to  hear  the  real  old  aboriginal  music.  It's  a  bit  complicated  on  ac-  count  of  the  language.  I  must  say  that  when  you  get  an  aboriginal  song  in  English  of  course  you  may  get  it  uncommonly  well  sung  but  it  seems  to  me  that  you  can't  help  losing  some  of  the  spirit  of  the  original—  I  mean  the  aboriginal.  To  show  you  what  I  mean  I  brought  back  a  real  aboriginal  love  song,  and  I'll  sing  it  to  you  in  the  origi-  nal  aboriginal,  so  that  there  shall  be  no  mistake  about  it.  If  there  is  any.  abo-  rigine  present  here  this  evening  I  defy  him  to  say  that  he  doesn't  recognise  his  own  language.  Of  course,  here  and  there  you  may  notice  little  bits  that  -  aren't  aboriginal—  bits  that  merely  utter  the  large  aboriginal  language  of  human  passion.  Well,  you  see,  I  didn't  know  abori-  ginal,  and  I  had  to  love  the  girl  the  best  way  I  could  in  Australian.  Then  she  replied  to  me  in  aboriginal,  and  our  little  duet  was  something  like  this—  (Air  from  ""Patience."")  Tell  me,  pretty  Jeanie-~  (I  called  all  the  young  gins  Jeanle  on  principle)  Tell  me,  pretty  Jeanie,  will  yon  marry  me}  Bogantungan  Burrabunia  Purdeet  Bungarr  I'll  give  you  half  my  victuals,  the  other  half  to  cook!

The.  second  verse  of  the  love  song,  you  may  notice,  goes  to  a  different  air  but  then  it  was  to  a  diffe-  rent  girl—  a  model  of  savage  beauty—  and  I  courted  her  like  this  —  (Aire  ""The  Keys  of  Heaven."")  Pretty  Jean,  I  love  you  trrue!  Thargomindah,,  Woolloomooloo!  That  meant  she  wanted  to  know  how  much  cash  I'd  got—  ladies  are  all  alike—  '  ,  Pretty  Jean,  I  love  you  true!  Thargomindah  Woolloomooloo!  Dark-eyed  Jeanie,  hear  my  song!

Then,  very  likely,  the  girl  would  sing  one  of  the  plaintive  old  aboriginal  laments,  so  inexpressibly  mournful  and  pathetic  —one  of  those  ancient  laments  for  a  lost  lover  —  like  this  —  (Air  'Waiting  at  the  Church.'i  Coolangatta  Taree  Howlong  Mittagong!

"ABORIGINAL  NEWSPAPER.   A  unique  newspaper  has  been  published  in  North  Queensland.  A  little  while  ago  the  Rev.  E.  R.  Gribble,  super  intendant  of  the  aboriginal  station  at  Yarrahah  near  Cairus,  issued  a  small  double  sheet  called  the  ""Yarrabah  News""  but  the  name  has  now  been  changed  to  the  ""Aboriginal  News""  ""as  this  is  the  only  newspaper  issued  purely  in  the  interest  of  the  aborigines  of  Australia.""  The  paper  is  entirely  ""composed""  by  the  aboriginal  inmates  of  the  mission,  under  the  direction  of  the  missionaries.  Rev.  E.  S  Chase  being  at  present  in  charge.  On  the  first  page  is  printed  the  aims  of  the  mission  and  the  prayer  used  by  the  Mitchell  River  Mission  party.   On  the  opposite  page  is  reprinted  the  notice  that  is  posted  at  the  headquarters  of  the  mission  :—  ""Visitors  are  kindly  requested  not  to  use  the  undermentioned  words  when  speaking  to  members  of  the  mission  :—(Gin'  (use  'black  woman'),  'niggers'  (use  'blacks'  or  'black  people)""  'Mary'  (use  'wife')  'Benjamin'  (say  'husband').   Editorially  the  opinion  is  expressed  that  it  is  time  something  was  done  by  the  Commonwealth  Parliament  to  prevent  the  sale  of  opium,  and  it  is  added  that  it  is  not  generally  known  that  the  natives  of  Australia  do  not  smoke  opium,  but  drink  it.  It  is  also  stated:  ""We  do  not  think  the  change  will  be  to  the  best  interests  of  the  blacks  from  the  care  of  Dr.  Roth  to  that  of  the  police.

"Aboriginal  Reserve.   Mr.  Foxton  (Home  Secretary)  :  It  must  be  borne  in  mind  that  even  now  the  possessor  of  a  miner's  right  had  to  find  out  what  were  Crown  lands,  because  a  miner  was  not  allowed  to  mine  on  private  property,  and  these  reserves  were  really  the  private  pro-  perty  of  the  aboriginals.  But  an  ex-  ception  had  been  made  in  favour  of   the  miner.  Now,  it  was  desired  by  the  representatives  of  the  miners  appar-  ently,  to  enable  ill-conditioned  per-  sons  who  were  not  miners—   Mr.  Browne:  You  know  better  than  that.  What  is  the  use  of  being  offen-  sive?   The  Home  Secretary:  He  did  not.   He  believed  that  that  was  the  infer-  ence  which  was  to  be  drawn.   Mr,  Browne:  I  distinctly  deny  that  any  such  inference  is  to  be  drawn.   The  Home  Secretary:  He  thought  the  hon.  gentleman  must  have  mis-  understood  him—   Mr.  Jackson  :  It  is  very  offensive  to  mining  representatives.   The  Home  Secretary:  He  could  not  see  it  at  all.  He  was  sorry  that  he  had  offended  hon.  members.  He  cer-  tainly  did  not  intend  to.   Mr.  Browne  :  Yon  said  that  the  min-  ing  representatives  wanted  to  allow  ill-conditioned  persons  to  go  on  these   reserves.   Mr.  J.  Hamilton  :  No  be  said  per-  son  who  were  not  miners.   The  Home  Secretary:  He  might  have  expressed  himself  in  a  way  he  did  not  intend  to,  and  if  he  had  done  so,  he  was  sorry.    What  he  wanted  to  say  was  that  this  would  be  the  result,  if  hon.  members  representing  mining  constituencies  followed  the  lead  of  the  hon.  member,  Mr.  Duns-  ford,  in  this  matter.  That  would  be  the  result  of  their  action,  whether  in-  tentionally  or  otherwise.

"ABORIGINAL  SUPERSTITION.   A  telegram  received  at  Adelaide  from  Oodnadatta  states  that  a  death  occurred  about  a  fortnight  ago  of  an  aborigine  named  ""Navy  Tom,""  a  black,  fine  physique,  whose  portrait  appears  on  the  cover  of  Foster  Fraser's  work  ""Quaint  Subjects  of   the  King.  This  native  was  comparatively  intelligent  and  civilised,  having  been  in  the  employment  of  whites  for  many  years,  and  physically  was  about  the  finest  type  in  the  north-west.  Yet  he  died  because  another  black,  an  enemy,  pointed  a  ""bone""  atl  him.  No  amount  of  reasoning  or  ridicule  on  the  part  of  the  whites  could  save  him.  Once  a  black  has  been  ""boned""  he  simply  wastes  away,  neither  easts  nor  sleeps  properly,  and  the  end  soon  comes.  The  aborigines  are  fatalists,  and  ""Navy  Tom""  was  no  except-  tion.  Referring  to  this  telegram  the  Pro-  tector  of  the  Aborigines.

"ABORIGINAL  IMPLEMENTS.   Dr.  Fritz  Noetling  read  a  paper  in  regard  to  the  names  of  na-  tive  weapons,  in  which  he  an-  alysed  carefully  all  that  is  known  in  regard  to  the  matter.  He  pointed  out  that  the  vocabulary  of  the  abori-  ginals  was  very  limited  in  extent.  Cal-  der,  whose  compilation  was  probably  the  most  comprehensive,  enumerated  only  1135  words,  some  of  which  were  unquestionably  adapted  from  European  sources.  The  results  of  his  investiga-  tion  tended  to  show  that  the  aborigin-  als  did  not  have  different  names  for  the  different  kinds  of  stone  imple-  ments  they  used.  If  it  could  be  prov-  ed,  as  he  thought  he  had  proved,  that  the  Tasmanian  natives  only  had  one  word  for  their  stone  implements,  and  it  was  by  no  means  too  rash  to  assume  that  those  races  which  populated  Eu-  rope  during  the  diluvial  and  tertiary  ages  also  used  one  word  to  designate  their  implements.  Mr.  R.M.  Johnstone  said  the  paper  was  one  of  the  most  important  he  had  listened  to.  Their  attention  hitherto  had  been  confined  to  the  things  them-  selves,  instead  of  to  the  language  ap-  plied  to  them.  Both  the  Tasmanian  and  Australian  races  would  afford  a  great  field  in  the  future  to  the  philolo-  gical  student,  and  Dr  Noetling  had  opened  up  a  question  that  would  be  pursued  with  great  interest.  It  was  the  beginning  of  a  very  important  study  in  connection  with  the  aborig-  inals.  He  pointed  out  that  already  an  important  work  had  been  perform-  ed  in  getting  phonographic  records  of  some  of  the  old  aboriginal  songs  and  speeches  by  the  late  Mrs.  Fanny  Smith,  who  was  the  last  living  des-  dendant  of  the  natives.  He  hoped  that  permanent  casts  of  these  records  would  be  made  ,  so  that  they  could  be  preserved  indefinitely.  They  would  he  justified  in  going  to  some  expense  to  preserve  these  last  records  of  an  extinct  race.  Mr.  H.  Ritz  said  that  there  was  no  record  of  the  actual  sounds  of  the  natives  gave  their  words.  The  records  were  very  meagre,  and  these  were  made  by  men  who  had  no  special  knowledge  of  philology.  The  number  of  words  in  the  aboriginal  language  was  small,  much  smaller  than  the  lists  which  had  been  drawn  up  would  lead  one  to  expect.  Many  of  the  words  appar-  ently  different  he  believed  to  be  really  blended,  and  the  apparent  difference  was  due  to  the  habit  the  Tasmanians  possessed,  in  common  with  the  South  Sea  Islanders,  of  interchanging  mem-  bers  of  various  sound  groups.  He  read  a  long  list  of  natives'  words  with  their  probable  meanings  and  conjectural  re-  lationships,  and  suggested  that  there  might  still  be  manuscripts  dealing  with  native  philology  in  existence  in  private  owners'  hands.  Dr.  Noetling  thought  that  Mr.  R.  M.  Johnstone's  suggestion  that  the  re-  cords  of  Mrs.  Fanny  Smith's  songs  and  speeches  should  be  preserved,  was  a  most  excellent  one.  The  object  of  his  paper  was  to  establish  whether  or  not  the  natives  gave  their  stone  imple-  ments  separate  named,  and  he  believ-  ed  it  could  be  shown  they  did  not.  Mr.  Bernard  Shaw  said  that  he  would  bring  the  question  of  getting  permanent  copies  of  the  Fanny  Smith  records  before  the  council.  Mr.  Russell  Young  thought  that  the  matter  of  expense  should  not  be  con-  sidered  if  they  could  obtain  permanent  records.  The  chairman  said  it  was  a  matter  of  regret  that  so  little  was  really  known  of  the  early  history  of  the  Tas-  manian  natives.  No  attempt  had  been  made  to  record  their  language  until  it  had  become  to  some  extent  corrupted  by  contact  with  Europeans  and  others.  He  thought  Dr.  Noetling's  paper  was  a  very  valuable  and  important  ome,  and  he  believed  it  was  only  one  of  many  that  would  be  equally  interest-  ing.

"ABORIGINAL  ATROCITIES   INFORMATION  has  been  received  from  Gul-  gong  to  the  effect  that  at  1  p.m.  on  Monday  two  aboriginals,  armed  with  one  rifle  and  a    tomahawk,  murdered  Alexander  M'Kay  an   elderly  married  selector,  residing  at  Sports-  man's  Hollow,  two  miles  from  Ulan,  and  about  twelve  miles  from  Gulgong    and  that  they  also  seriously  wounded  Mrs.  M'Kay.  The  aboriginals  are  believed  to  have  fled  from  Breelong,  via  Merrygoen,  after  the  murders  at  Mawbey's  house,  to  six  miles  north  Gulgong,  where  they  were  seen  at  daybreak,  thence  to  Sportsman's  Hollow.  They  stole  two  horses  and  one  saddle  from  Mr.  M  Kay's  house,  and  are  believed  to  have  gone  towards  Wollar,  where  the  country  is  difficult  and  mountainous.  The  distance  across  country  from  Breelong  is  ,  about  sixty  miles.  Later  news  concerning  the  murder  by  blacks  near  Gulgong  states  that  Mrs.  M'Kay  is  dead.  The  husband  and  wife  were  mutilated  with  a  tomahawk.  An  adopted  daughter  of  the  M'Kays  was  threatened,  but  escaped.  It  is  surmised,  that  the  cause  of  the  massacre  was  M'Kay's  refusal  of  food  to  the  blacks,  who  were  armed  with  re  peater  rifles.  After  M  Kay  was  murdered  his  horse  and  accoutrements  were  stolen  from  the  residence.

"ABORIGINAL  MURDER.  -----  ""Peter,""  a  stalwart  aboriginal  native,  pleaded  not  guilty  in  the  Kalgoorlie  Circuit  Court  Wednesday  morning  before  Mr.  Justice,  Burnside  to  a  charge  that  he,  on  March  26,  at  Fraser's  Range,  murdered  ""Georgie,""  a  gin.  Mr.  G.  T.  Wood  prosecuted  and  Mr.  Brown  defended  the  accused.  Evidence  similar  to  that  already  published  was  given  by  ""Maggie,""  Thomas  Trott,  ""Jenny,""  Dr.  R.  R.  Harvey,  and  Constables  McKinley  and  Cusack.  This  showed  that  on  March  26  the  accused  wanted  the   deceased  to  get  him  some  whiskey  at  the  homestead,  and  that,  when  she  refused  and  laughed  at  him,  he  beat  her  with  a  hockey  stick  from  the  homestead  till  she  fell  down,  after  which  he  kicked  her.  During  the  next  24  hours  ""Georgie""  died,  and  was  buried  by  the  natives.  In  formation  was  given  to  the  police,  and  the  body  was  exhumed  by  Cons  table  McKinley,  and  examined  by  Dr.  Harvey,  who  found  that  death  was  due  to  the  injuries  she  receiv  ed  on  her  body.  ""Peter""  escaped  into  the  bush  and  was  captured  several  days  later  by  Mounted  constable  Cusack.  This  closed  the  case  for  the  Crown.  ""Peter,""  who  was  affirmed  to  speak  the  truth,  said  that  he  lived  with  ""Georgie.""  On  March  26  he  saw  a  bottle  of  whiskey  at  the  kitchen.  He  saw  ""Georgie,""  and  told  her  to  come  home.  She  said  she  would  come  behind  him  and  would  not  drink.  He  went  to  the  camp  and  ""Jimmy's""  wife  came  down  afterwards  and  told  him  that  ""Georgie""  was  drunk.  He  went  towards  the  kitchen  with  the  peram  bulator  and  a  hockey  stick  to  play.  He  met  ""Georgie,""  who  was  drunk,  and  he  was  angry  with  her.  He  told  her  to  go  back  and  get  more  whiskey  and  not  to  come  back  to  him  again.  She  laughed.  at  him,  and  he  told  her  that  he  did  not  like  it  and  would  give  her  a  hiding.  Alex,  the  boundary  rider,  gave  the  liquor  to  her.  He  would  not  give  witness  any,  but  only  to  the  women.  If  their  women  went  away  with  white  men  it  was  their  custom  to  beat  them.  Mr.  Wood:  Do  you  ever  drink  whiskey  ?   Peter  :  Sometimes.  Not  much,  Was  it  not  because  she  would  not  get  whiskey  for  you  that  you  beat  her  ?-  I  told  her  to  get  it  for  her  self.  This  closed  the  case  for  the  de  fence.  The  jury  returned  a  verdict  that  the  accused  was  guilty  of  man  slaughter.  His  Honour  (to  the  accused):  The  jury  have  found  you  guilty  of  kill  ing  ""Georgie.""  Accused  :  Not  guilty.  Mr.  Brown  :  He  thinks  he  is  pleading.  His  Honour  (to  the  accused):  I  arm  very  much  afraid  that  I  must   take  more  notice  of  what  the  jury  say  than  what  you  do.  You  will  go  to  Fremantle  jail  for  three  years,  with  hard  labour.  ""Peter,""  who  had  regarded  the  proceedings  with  amusement,  sud-  denly  looked  very  serious.

"Aboriginal  Vendetta.   The  Australian  aborigine,  lowest  in  the  human  scale,  has  his  vendetta,  though  it  is  not  invariably  revenge  that  he  seeks.  How  his  mind  in  the  matter  works  has  been  shown  by  Darwin.

"ABORIGINAL  SPEECH.   At  a  meeting  of  the  Royal  Society  of.  Tasmania  on  Monday,  Mr  Herman  Ritz,  M.A.,  read  a  paper,  entitled  ""An  introduction  to  aboriginal  speech  in  Tasmania.""  Mr  Ritz  said  the  life  of  a  population  invariably  assumed  a  form  which  largely  depended  on  the   climate  and  geographical  features  and  the  facility  of  intercourse  with  the  denizens  of  other  lands.  If  they  took  heed  they  might  hear  the  sounds  and  the  voices  that  passed  away  with  Truganini.  To  the  observing  ear  of  the  scientists  the  remnants  of  the  feasts  of  the  aboriginals,  their  imple-  ments,  and  the  scanty  records  of  their   words  and  doings  spoke  in  the  lan-  guage  of  their  own  of  those  whose  places  we  had  taken  for  good  or  ill.  It  was  the  words,  the  records  of  the  actual  songs  of  the  voice  that  was  still,  that  he  would  confine  their  attention,  and  their  present  purpose  was  to  clear  the  ground  and  mark  out  the  founda-  tion  for  constructing  a  scientific  re-  production  of  the1  language  of  the  aboriginals  of  Tasmania.  As  far  as   he  was  aware,  the  work  done  in  that  direction  had  not  hitherto  been  ex-  tensive.  After  stating  his  attempt  to  simplify  the  spelling,  Mr  Ritz  com-  pared  three  versions  of  an  aboriginal  song,  accounting  for  every  word,  and  explaining  the  meaning  of  the  sent-   ences.  He  said  there  was  no  sign  of  any  accidence.  The  words  seemed  in-  variable  in  form  and  widely  applicable  in  meaning.  The  words  were  pro-  bably  supplemented  by  gestures  to  define  their  exact  meaning.  In  that  respect  a  parallel  was  found  in  the  sentences  of  the  Chinese  language.  The   fact  that  the  song  existed  in  different  dialects  made  it  most  valuable.  Quite  probably  the  song  was  connected  with  some,  important  tribal  ceremonies.  One   of  the  interpretations  given  of  the  song  was  :  ""Mighty  runs  the  bush  fire.  My  heel  is  speedy  and  my  foot  is  swift.  Come,  thou,  and  run  with  the  speed  of  a  bird.  Thou  art  a  real  warrior,  a  man,  indeed  warrior,  hero!""  Mr  Ritz,  in  reply  tio  Sir  Gerald  Strickland  as  to  whether  any   observations  had  been  made  as  to  any  trace  of  the  aboriginal  tongue  amongst  the  half-castes  of  Barren.  Island,  said,  owing  to  the  mixed  dialects,  it  would  hardly  be  possible  to  find  any  trace  of  the  pure  tongue  there,  except  that  it  might  be  kept  for  secret  communi-  cation.  Since  he  studied  the  questions  he  had  gained  a  great  deal  of  informa-  tion,  and  he  hoped  to  give  further  re-  sults  at  a  future  meeting.  Dr.  Noet-   ling  and  Mr  R.  M.  Johnston  spoke  in  high  terms  of  the  value  of  the  re-  search  of  Mr  Ritz,  and  they  hoped  he  would  continue  his  studies,  and  that  the  result  would  be  placed  before  the  scientific  world.  Mr  Johnston  referred  to  some  phonograph  records  having  been  taken  of  the  native  lan-  guage  spoken  by  the  late  Fanny  Smith,  and  these  might  prove  of  great  value  to  Mr  Ritz  in  his  studies.",151930702,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/151930702,ABORIGINAL SPEECH.,Article,1908-11-19,4,4,"At a meeting of the Royal Society of Tasmania on Monday, Mr Herman Ritz, M.A., read a paper, entitled ""An introduction to aboriginal speech",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article151930702?searchTerm=aboriginal,,742,"Daily Telegraph (Launceston, Tas. : 1883 - 1928)",212.8291473388672,very relevant

Doubtless  at  the  Federal  festivities  Mr.  Meston  will  show  a  fine  body  of  representa-  tive  aboriginals.  It  may  be  anticipated  that  under  his  guidance  this  part  of  the  programme  will  be  done  properly,  and  that  the  blacks  themselves  and  their  weapon  displays  will  be  a  revelation  to  even  a  majority  of  Queenslanders,  and  an  interest-  ing  education  for  our  school  children.

Pos-  sibly  advantage  will  be  taken  of  the  blacks'  presence  in  town  to  have  a  series  of  cor-  robbories  as  well  as  a  display  of  weapons.

"Aboriginal  Servants   (By  K.L.Y.  in  Melbourne  ""Argus."")   These  days  the  Sydney  press  is  de-  luged  with  letters,  indignant,  and  otherwise,  from  mistresses  and  maids  and  all  of  them  deal  with  the  same  old  theme—the  servant  question.  The  while  I  sit  tight  in  my  out-back  Queensland  home  I  wonder  what  my  city  friends  would  think  of  my  con-  tentment.   I  have  had  twejve  years'  experience   of  aboriginal  servants,  and  know  that  a  good,  or  even  average,  speci-  men  is  a  very  valuable  help  indeed.  They  are  gentle  creatures  about  the  house,  though  war-like  enough  in  camp  occasionally.  ""Rosy""  greets  you  with  a  flash  of  dazzling  teeth,  and  a  cheerful,  ""Mornin',  Missus,""  and  is  no  whit  disconcerted  by  the  fact  that  her  head  is  bandaged  in  a  dirty,  blood-stained  rag,  one  eye  blackened—well,  that  is  hardly  a  suitable  term—let  us  say,  ""invali-  ded''—and  her  first  and  second  fingers  split  apart.  Inquiries  elicit  the  fact  that  ""Car-   line""  has  been  making  scan'lous  eyes  at  Rosey's  ""murree""  (blackfellow),  or,  maybe,  vice  versa.  Anyhow,  a   yam  stick  or  two  has  been  picked  upon  to  settle  all  differences,  and  Rosey,  being  the  smaller,  is  decidedly  the  worse  for  wear.  She  takes  the  fortune  of  war  in  a  philosophical  fashion,  however,  and,  with  the  in-  jured  hand  bound  up,  is  prepared  to  go  on  with  her  work  as  usual.   With  regard  to  the  gins,  two  things  are  undesirable.  Don't  have   them  living  at  the  homestead,  and  draw  the  line  at  piccaninnies  about  the  kitchen.  The  first  is  seldom  a  success,  and  is  far  better  not  attemp-  ted.  The  women  work  all  the  better  for  a  few  hours'  freedom  at  night  at  it  constantly,  they  are  apt  to  turn  sulky.  As  for  the  picaninnies,  they  are  most  fascinating  little  creatures,  and  always  ready  to  make  friends.  At  first  it  is  rather  amusing  to  have  a  little  ragged  creature  steal  to  one's  side,  and  beg  for  ""plums"".   But  by-and-by  it  becomes  rather  a  nuisance,  especially  if  they  take  to  making  private  excursions  to  the  cake-box,  or  the  biscuit  barrel,  in   the  dining  room.  Everyone  has  her  own  way  of  man-   aging  her  gins,  and  round  here  it  is  quite  a  common  thing  for  a  lazy  one  to  receive  personal  chastisement  at  the  hands  of  her  mistress,  and  occas-  ionally  an  even  more  severe  form   from  ""the  boss,""  and  a  stick.  This   'is  ""old  style,""  and  curiously  enough,  the  niggers  seldom  resent  it.  Now   and  then  a  gin  so  punished  will  de-  part  for  good  and  all  but,  as  a  rule,  if  they  leave  at  all,  they  invariably  drift  back  again  in  the  course  of  a  week  or  so  and  return  to  work  as  though  nothing  had  happened.  For  my  part,  I  could  never  bring  myself  to  touch  a  woman,  either  black  or  white  and  in  all  my  experience  I  have  never  but  once  had  the  least  trouble.  In  that  case  the  girl,  who  was  living  in  the  house,  turned  sulky  and  finally  departed  to  the  camp  for  good.   As  to  their  qualification.  They  can  to  taught  to  cook  they  wash,   scrub  and  iron  to  perfection  and   excel  in  ---------------and  brasses,   ------------------in  their  movements   generally  clean  in  person,  and  obed-  ient,  and  never  saucy,  and  careful  with  crockery.  Lastly,  they  are  ex-  tremely  trustworthy  with  children,  and  make  the  kindest  of  nurses.   Of  course,  they  are  human,  and  have  tempers,  but  my  experience  is  that  the  more  like  white  women  you  treat  them  the  less  trouble  you  will  have.   Wages  vary  never  exceeding  five  shillings  per  week.  Sometimes  this  is  paid  partly,  or  wholly,  in  kind   sometimes  in  cash.  This  is  accord-   ing  to  the  individual  fancy  of  the  gins.  One  is  generally  employed,   though  often  in  a  big  house-hold  .  there  are  two—one  exclusively  for  laundry  work.",44454880,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/44454880,Aboriginal Servants,Article,1907-02-23,4,4,"These days the Sydney press is deluged with letters, indignant and otherwise, from mistresses and, maids and all of them deal with the same",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44454880?searchTerm=aboriginal,,79,"Morning Post (Cairns, Qld. : 1897 - 1907)",212.8291473388672,very relevant

There  has  for  many  years  been  a  very  stringent  supervision  of  the  aboriginals  in  settlements,  even  in  the  more  thickly  populated  districts  :  but  it  was  only  during  the  past  two  or  three  yours  that  an  attempt  was  made  to  turn  the  labour  to  ac-  count.  A  eommencement  was  made  by  hiring  out  gangs  from  the  Barambah  settlement  in  the  south  for  scrub  cutting.  etc.,  and  it  was  found  that  the  men  did  tho  work  remarkably  well.  A  proportion  of  the  earnings  was  deducted  for  the  keep  of  tho  families  in  the  settlement.  The  sys-    tem  was  extended  to  tho  young  girls  who  were  drawn  upon  to  solve  the  domestic  servant  ques  tion  and  at  present  in  Brisbane  there  are  about  200  full-blood  and  half-castes  in  service,  who  are  doing  so  well  that  the  demand  is  twice  greater  than  the  supply.  Numbers  of  aboriginals  have  also  been  employed  in  the  sugar  industry:   but  tho  present  Government  has  not  encouraged    this  sphere  of  activity,  on  the  ground  that  it    would  give  a  wrong  impression  when  the  State    was  endeavouring  to  get  agricultural  labourers    from  Europe  for  the  sugar  Industry.  At  the  same  time,  sugar  farmers  are  pressing  the  Go-   vernment  for  permits  to  employ  aboriginals    and  is  is  said  that  quite  700  could  be  absorbed    easily.  The  Chief  Protector  holds  very  strong    views  about  the  suitability  of  the  fine  northern    tribes  fur  sugar  work.  A  scheme  has  also  been    proposed  by  a  syndicate  which  desires  to  de-    velop  Fraser  Island  on  the  Queensland  coast,    and  to  employ  aboriginal  labour  in  fishing  for  tho  canning  works.  If  aboriginal  labour  were  takon  in  tho  sugar  districts  a  big  northern  sta-  tion  would  be  established  as  a  recruiting  sta-  tion  and  there  also  all  labour  for  the  pearling    boats  would  have  to  be  signed  on  and  off.",61547774,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/61547774,Aboriginal Labour.,Article,1908-03-28,6,6,"Opinion is changing in Queensland regarding the value of the aboriginal as a labourer.

"ABORIGINAL  STORIES.   A  gentleman  at  Ravenswood,  who  takes  an  interest  in  the  fast  departing   aborigines,  informs  us  of  the  demise  of  an  old  gin  who  was  known  these  as   Mary  Ann  Wyatt,  but  whose  native   title  was  ""Booinbelba  Toothan.""  The  old  woman  was  the  gin  of  ""Mala   Boolaroo""  better  known  as  King  Jimmy  of  Mount  Wyatt.  The  Royal  pair  had  a  considerable  family,  all  of  whom,  except  one  married  to  an  abor-   iglnal  stockman  at  Mt.  McConnell,  are  now  among  the  blacks  who  go  begging  from  door  to  door  at  Ravenswood.  The  old  gin  was  the  last  of  the  old  '  brigade  of  blacks  she  was  born  at  Mount  Wyatt  'long  time  before  *Mi-   kolo  (white  man)  come  up.""  Willie  Wyatt  was  quite  broken  up  over  the   demise  of  his  royal  mother,  and  sad-  ly  remarked  to  sympathising  friends:  ""Can't  eat  any  tucker,  can't  do  any   blooming  work,  sinking  feeling  alto-  gedder.'""  He  has  now  sufficiently  recovered,  however,  take  up  a   tikpenny  collection  to  defray  the  obsequies  of  the  Royal  lady,  his   mother.  In  the  meantime  an  aborig-  inal  named  ""Stepper  Thompson""  has   left  for  Mt.  McConnell  to  carry  the  sad  news  to  interested  friends  and  relatives.  The  foregoing  being  shown   to  ""Along  the  Line""  he  at  once  added   another  aboriginal  story  as  follows  :—   ""For  the  last  ten  years  or  more  an  old  black,  helpless  and  blind  with   age,  has  lived  in  the  camp  at  Glen-  dower,  on  the  Flinders,  not  far  from  where  I  live.  He  was  provided  for  by  Robert  Gray,  who,  be  it  said,  Is  kindly  to  all  his  old  blacks.  ""Old  Jack""  lived  in  his  little  gunyah,  and  in  the  day  he  would  come  out  and   sit  in  the  shade,  motionless  almost,  except  when  friendly  voices  spoke  to   him  and  then  he  smiled  in  his  vacant   toothless  way,  when  the  other  blacks   told  him  who  spoke  to  him.  So  he  lived,  month  after  month,  year  after   year,  led  about  or  carried  by  the  others,  until  recently.  In  the  night  a  great  storm  of  rain  and  thunder  and   lightening  came,  and  when  the  dawn  gave  light,  there  out  on  the  Downs,   by  the  camp,  half  bedded  in  the  black  soil,  was  old  Jack,  dead.

"ABORIGINAL  MISSIONS.   Writing  from  Manunka  Mission,  Forster,  on  August  28,  Mrs.  J.  Matthews  says:  —  Pas-  sengers  passing  to  and  fro  in  steamers  on  the  Murray  River  between  Mannum  and  Morgan  will  probably  notice  the  new  Abori-  ginal  Mission  Station,  Manunka.

About  20  children,  mostly  natives,  attend  school  daily,  and  visitors  are  much  pleased  to  see  the  improvement  in  them.  Canon  Bussell  reported  in  the  visitors'  book  on  June  16  last  —  ""I  visited  the  school  this  morning,  and  was  pleased  with  the  appearance  and  discipline  of  the  children,  which  shows  that  good  work  is  being  done.

We  trust  many  interested  in  the  uplifting  and  Christianising  of  the  natives  may  help  as  much  as  possible.  The  opening  of  the  school  for  the  Government  was  a  red-letter  day  on  the  mission.  About  100  persons  were  present,  50  of  whom  were  natives.  After  amusements,  tea,  and  a  lantern  lecture,  Mr.  William  Towill,  a  well  known  resident  of  the  district,  spoke  ap  provingly  of  the  progress  of  the  work.

"Aboriginal  Myths.   Quaint  and  original,  with  a  fitful  fancy  running  through  them,  these  myths  are  worth  searching  for,  for  here  and  there  the  odd,  graceful  imagery  repays  any  one  who  is  interested  in  the  poor  de  crepid  race  that  once  owned  this  coun   who  were  'kings'  here  when  we  were  probably  savages  is  dying  out  miserably,  and  the  least  we  can  do  is  to  appreciate  their  traditions.  In  the  beginning,  black  men  wore  wings  and  chased  winged  game    they  were  prosperous,  but  grew  weary  for  a  place  to  rest  their  feet,  so  they  begged  help  of  the  stars  and  other  heavenly  bodies.  Each  sent  a  contribu  tion  towards  a  settlement.  The  stars  sent  rocks  and  sand,  the  moon  sent  water  for  sea,  rivers,  and  springs,  the  evening  star  sent  rich  soil  for  growing  things,  the  sun  sent  animals  and  plants,  and  the  wings  were  dropped  at  once  for  the  'sole  of  a  foot'  to  rest  on.  Another  myth  states  that  the  gum  in  the  hearts  of  wattle  trees  is  made  by  shoot  ing  stars  lodging  there  and  breaking  into  bits.  The  whispering  of  the  leaves  after  dark  is  the  voice  of  a  dear  one  that  is  dead,  and  wishes  to  let  you  know  that  he  or  she  is  near.  A  huge  serpent  pro  duced  creation  with  a  blow  of  his  tail.  The  reason  for  the  pelican  and  mag  pie  being  marked  as  they  are,  is  told  thus.  The  white  pelicans  caught  some  fish,  and  asked  the  black  magpie  to  cook  it,  fearing  to  soil  themselves  the  magpie  stole  them,  and  in  the  fight  they  fell  amonc  white  ashes  and  sot  mottled,  the   pelicans  fell  on  the  fish,  and  the  silvery  scales  stuck  to  them.  When  rain  was  wanted,  the  crow  was  asked  to  sing,  and  his  croak  brought  rain    it  ought  to,  it  is  powerful  enough  —  Annaitjeranang  Rotjer  tarn  pat  Jeranangk  !  Blaikie's  boot  protectors  are  said  to  have  made  for  Blaikie  over  half  a  mil  lion  of  money.  A  damsel  has  framed  a  verdict  a  jury  gave  in  her  favour  in  a  suit  in  a  breach  of  promise  of  marriage,  and  has  hung  it  conspicuously  in  her  parlour  as  a  fright  ful  warning  to  all  triflers.  A  remarkable  union  of  fur  and  feather  has  occurred  at  the  Cordeaux,  near  Mount  Kembla,  a  hen  having  taken  under   her  wing  a  tamily  ot  seven  cnicKens.  The  mother  makes  no  objection.  Prob  ably  she  had  promised  the  mother  not  to  lure  them  into  the  water,  under  the  pre  text  of  teaching  them  to  swim.  We  have  received  from  the  Benevo  lent  Society  of  New  South  Wales  the  Christmas  number  of  the  Charities  Gazette  and  its  special  supplement,  Yule  Tide.  Both  are  full  of  interesting  and  valuable  information,  and  the  supplement  is  excel  lent  both  in  get  up  and  material,  and  will,  we  trust,  be  the  means  of  bringing  home  more  vividly  to  the  citizens  of  New  South  Wales  the  good  work  that  the  Benevolent  Society  is  doing  and  its  need  for  funds  to  meet  the  many  calls  upon  it  made  in  the  nanie  of  charity.

The  three  degrees  of  comparison  as  understood  in  America  get  on,  get  honour,  and  get  honest.  Some  million  aires  die  before  reaching  the  last.  The  general  feeling  is  that  this  country  never  experienced  such  an  electoral  muddle  as  that  of  the  recent  Federal  campaign.  It  is  agreed  that  somebody  does  not  want  the  ballot-box  at  all.  Sir  Edward  Grey  on  preferentialism  :  'A  trade  like  the  ironworks  of  Great  Britain,  with  a  production  of  £150,000,000  worth  per  year,  will  not  be  injured  by  importing  /'i5,ooo  worth  from  foreign  countries.'  Shaftesbury  Reformatory,  till  so  lately  residential  flats  for  naughty  little  girls  and  State  apprentices,  is  now  occupied  by  the  matron,  her  family,  and  the  other  officials,  who  vainly  look  round  the  miles  of  stone  flagging  in  search  of  some  little  mislaid  girl  who  may  perchance  have  been  lefst  behind.  Iron  bars  and  stone  cells  seem  sort  of  lonesome  with  no  one  to  make  use  of  them.  Herbert  Spencer's  description  of  the  woman  whom  he  could  have  courted  was  that  of  one  who  '  must  have  beauty  of  countenance  and  grace  of  movement  whose  figure  must  be  good  and  whose  manners  must  be  attractive.  She  must  be  effeminate,  of  a  high  order  of  intel  lect,  and  yet  not  a  bus  bleu.'  But  he  never  found  her,  or  if  he  did  was  not  aware  of  it,  which  amounted  to  the  same  thing.  The  excellence  of  the  arrangements  now  made  in  the  management  of  the  Sydney  Ferries  to  meet  their  immense  traffic  was  well  shown  in  the  way  the  Christmas  holiday  throngs  were  handled.  An  entire  city  swept  through  to  and  fro,  and  all  passed  without  hitch  or  accident.  Mr.  Todd  is  to  be  con  gratulated,  and  certainly  no  small  credit  is  due  to  the  skippers  and  crews  of  the  various  boats.  The  service  is  perhaps  as  good  as  any  to  be  found  in  any  part  of  the  world.  A  successful  concert  was  given  by  the  pupils  of  Miss  Naylor  at  Manchester  Unity  Hall  on  December  17th.  Some  excellent  music  was  rendered.  The  prizes  and  certificates  presented  by  Mr.  Bennett  were  as  follows  :  —  Senior  (for  highest  marks  gained)  :  Gold  medal,  Gladys  Howard    silver  medal,  Kathleen  M'Ewen,  Bella  Thomas.  Intermediate:  Gold  medal,  Allie  Wingrove    silver  medal,  Stella  Spears.  Junior  :  Dorothy  Tan,  Alice  Miller.  Practical  —  Senior  (Trinity  College)  :  Ida  Gibbes.  Inter  mediate,  Ruby  Flemming.  Theory  —  Intermediate  :  Jessie  Stone.  Junior  :  Violet  Barry.  At  the  close  of  the  pro  ceedings  Miss  Naylor  was  presented  with  a  handsome  silver  manicure  set  by  her  pupils  as  a  mark  of  their  love  and  esteem.  She  was  also  the  recipient  of  a  lovely  bouquet.  Mr.  Naylor,  jun.,  very  suitably  replied.  Songs  were  rendered  by  the  Misses  Gillespie,  Bertie,  Dolphin.  Banjo  and  piano  solo  by  two  little  mites  was  much  appreciated.   Mr.  Brander  Matthews,  in  Harper's  Magazine  for  November,  gives  a  collec  tion  of  epigrams  by  American  writers.  Here  are  some  :  —  All  honour  to  Woman,  the  Sweetheart,  the  Wife,  The  delight  of  our  homesteads  by  night  and  by  day,  The  darling  who  never  does  barm  in  her  life  —  '  Except  when  determined  to  have  her  own  way.  Some  epigrams  by  John  G.  Saxe  are  directed  against  feminine  failings.  His  '  A  Dilemma  '  runs  thus  :  'Whenever  I  marry,'  says  masculine  Ann,  'I  must  really  insist  upon  wedding  a  man  !'  But  what  if  the  man  (for  men  are  but  human)  Should  be  equally  nice  about  svedding  a  woman  ?  The  late  Anna  Reeve  Aldrich  gave  some  lines  the  enigmatic  title  '  Sup  pose  '  '  :  How  sad  if,  by  some  strange  new  law,  All  kisses  scarred    For  she  who  is  most  beautiful  Would  be  most  marred    And  we  might  be  surprised  to  see  Some  lovely  wife  Smooth-visaged,  while  a  seeming  prude  Was  marked  for  life.  Miss  Mary  Ange  de  Vere  puts  sub  tlety  into  her  '  Friend  and  Lover  '  :  When  Psyche's  friend  becomes  her  lover,  How  sweetly  these  conditions  blend  !  But,  oh!  what  anguish  to  discover  Her  lover  has  become  her  —  friend  !  When  a  Polish  Jewess  is  married  it  is  usual  for  her  hair  to  be  cut  off  and  replaced  by  a  wig,  for  the  purpose,  it  is  said,  of  lessening  her  attraction  in  the  eyes  of  men  other  than  her  husband.  The  trouble  is  that  it  may  also  lessen  her  attraction  in  the  eyes  of  her  husband.   EQUAL—  ON  POLLING  DAY.

A  report  to  the  London  School  Board  shows  that  the  per  centage  of  attendance  at  their  schools  in  London  is  85-6  per  cent,  substantially  ahead  of  the  whole  kingdom.  At  St.  Helens  (Lancashire)  a  half  holiday  is  given  every  four  weeks  when  the  attendance  at  a  school  has  reached  93  per  cent.  To  secure  regular  attendance  the  master  of  a  Devonshire  school  has  group  photographs  taken  periodically  of  those  who  attend  regu  larly.  Two  Parisian  papers,  La  Petit  Parisien  and  the  Matin,  have  been  publishing  what  are  said  to  be  the  Princess  Radzi  well's  version  of  her  various  adventures  with  the  late  Cecil  Rhodes.

Mr.  Rhodes  loved  me  and  I  loved  him,  but  the  idea  of  becoming  Queen  of  Africa  dazzled  me.'  She  alleged  that  they  quarrelled  because  she  urged  him  to  affect  a  reconciliation  of  the  Dutch  at  the  Cape,  and  that  Mr.  Rhodes  employed  spies  to  watch  on  the  doings  of  Lord  Milner.

In  the  report  on  the  exploration  of  North  west  Kimberley,  by  Mr.  F.  S.  Brockman  (leader),  published  by  the  West  Australian  Government,  are  some  interesting  illustra-  tions  and  descriptions  of  aboriginal  drawings  found  and  photographed  during  the  tour.   Mr.  Brockman,  in  his  report,  writes:-""A  remarkable  custom  of  the  aborigines  of  the  western  part  of  the  district,  south  from  Admiralty  Gulf,  is  that  of  painting  repre-  sentations  of  the  human  figure,  beasts,  rep-  tiles,  &c.,  on  almost  every  available,  smooth,  vertical  surface  to  be  found  in  the  sand-  stone  ranges.  The  first  specimen  of  these  which  we  met  with  was  near  Camp  F.B.  25,   and  consisted  of  a  row  of  figures.  The  place  was  one  which  had  been  used  evidently  for  a  great  number  of  years  for  depositing  the  bones  of  the  dead.  It  will  be  seen  that  the  figures  are  clothed,  and  all  in  a  similar  style  of  garment,  with  what  appears  like  a  neck  tie  just  below  the  throat.  Curiously  this  same  style  of  figure,  similarly  dressed,  oc-  curred  wherever  paintings  of  any  extent   were  found.  In  all  there  is  an  absence  of  the  mouth,  and  what  appears  to  be  a  halo  round  the  head.  These  figures  agree  in  these  particulars  with  those  found  by  Grey  on  the  Glenelg  in  1837.  The  colours  used  are  red,  yellow,  black,  and  white,  the  black  being  charcoal,  and  the  other  colours  argillaceous  earth,  specimens  of  which  we  found  care-  fully  wrapped  up  in  paper  bark  parcels  in   most  of  the  camps  which  had  been   hurriedly  owing  to  our  a  the  extent  of  the,  ?  ,.r>inf  drawings  occur.

About  50  friends  from  farms  in  the  neighborhood,  and  others,  were  gathered  together,  while  about  50  natives  crowded  into  the  little  pine  school-house,  which  was  decorated  with  flags  and  evergreens.  A  table  was  spread  with  good  things,  &c,  Games  and  singing  entertained  all,  and  as  the  children  marched  into  the  school-house  and  sang  ""God  save  the  King,""  and  praises  to  the  ""King  of  Kings,""  the  scene  was  joyous    indeed.

"Decidedly  Aboriginal.   Some  years  ago,  before  corrugated  iron  was  a  ""  getatable  ""  commodity  in  the  up-country  districts,  sheets  of  bark  stripped  from  the  stringy-bark,   box,  and  several  other  kinds  of  our  forest  trees,  were  in  good  demand  for  roofing  purposes,  particularly  in  and  around  the  different  settlements.  I  remember  a  blackfellow  who  often  had  a  budgery  big  spree  by  swapping  shoots  of  bark  for  quart  bottles  of  snake-juice,  labelled  rum,  —  such  snake  juice  being  the  whole  stock-in-trade  of  many  a  shanty  and  way-side  pub  in  those  days.  Jacky  was  no  doubt  an  adept  at  either  stowing  rum  or  stripping  bark.  I  have  heard  that  he  has  been  known  to  get  on  the  out  side  of  a  quart  of  rum,  between  9  o'clock  in  the  morning  and  4  o'clock  in  the  evening,  and  at  the  latter  hour  of  the  same  day  accosting  everyone  he  met  with  ""  You  bin  gib  it  shillin',  Jacky  blurry  thirsty!""  Be  this  as  it  may.  I  have  known  Jacky  and  his  mate  to  take  three  seven  or  eight  foot  lengths  of  bark  from  a  standing  tree  and  get  all  down  safely  and  flattened  out  without  a  crack  or  split.  Jacky  invariably  cut  out  all  his  bark  in  rum,  and  as  his  mate  did  not  drink,  it  has  often  puzzled  me  what  he  got   for  his  share.  It  seems  the  first  time  Jacky's  mate  tasted  rum  it  somehow  went  the  wrong  way,  got  in  his  wind-  pipe  and  went  very  close  to  choking  him,  and  never  after  could  he  be  in  duced  to  taste.  If  at  any  time  he  was  offered  spirits  of  any  sort  he  would  say  ""  Baal  mine  drinkit  boilet  water  no  blurry  fear  !  ""  Perhaps  it  was  ad  miration  for  a  mate  who  could  swal  low  boilit  water  like  cool  cream  that  induced  him  to  help  Jacky  strip  the  bark.  After  a  time  the  squatters  around  would  not  allow  Jacky  to  strip  the  trees  on  their  holdings,  and  many  a  big  oath  Jacky  swore.  He  was  riled  at  having  his  rum  supply  sud-  denly  shut  off.  Someone  told  Jacky  that  the  Queen  told  the  Government  that  the  blackfellows  were  to  be  allowed  to  strip  bark  when  and  where  they  liked,  so  one  time  when  the  Go  vernor  was  in  Wagga,  Jacky  stopped  him  in  the  street,  and  put  this  ques  tion  to  him  :  ""  Say,  mister  blurry  guvment,  can  I  stripit  the  bark  ?  ""  ""  Yes,""  said  the  Governor,  ""  of  course  you  can.""  After  this,  when  Jacky  got  a  rum  or  two  in,  he  would  sit  down  on  the  butt  of  a  stump  at  his  camp  and  hold  forth  something  after  this  fashion  —  Good  phella,  mine  thinkit,  that  white  phella  Queen    Him  blurry  good  fren  to  black  pheller  been.

The  na-  tive  threw  a  spear  at  the  gin,  but  missed  her,  and  the  occupants  of  the  cart  got  down  to  protect  her,  but  the  aggressor  threatened  to  spear  them  if  they  came  too  close,  and  he  then  speared  the  woman.

"ABORIGINAL  DOMESTICITY.   What  was  the  origin  of  the  clubs  to  which  men  resort  so  frequently  and  which   are  kept  sacred  from  the  feet  of  women?  Mr.  F.  J.  Gillen,  in  the  course  of  his  lec-  ture  on  Thursday  evening,  suggested  an  idea.  For  ages  past  the  aborigines  of  Aus-  tralia  have  at  each  camping  place  reserved  a  spot  which  women  and  children  were  for-  bidden  to  approach.  ""'That.""  says  Mr.  Gillen,  ""was  the  primitive  origin  of  a  men's  club.""  The  women  of  the  native  tribes  also  made  camps  which  men  were  not  permitted  to  enter,  and  perhaps  the  American  idea  of  women's  clubs  is  derived  from  such  a  source.

"ABORIGINAL  SERVANTS.      By  K.L.Y.   These  days  the  Sydney  press  is  deluged  with  letters,  indignant  and  otherwise,  from  mistresses  and  maids,  and  all  of  them  deal  with  the  same  old  theme-the  servant  que  tion.    The  while  I  sit  tight  in  my  out-back  Queensland  home  I  wonder  what  my  city  friends  would  think  of  my  contentment.   I  have  had  twelve  years'  experience  of  aboriginal  servants,  and  know  that  a  good,  or  even  average  specimen  is  a  very  valuable  help  indeed.  They  are  gentle  creatures  about  the  house  though  warlike  enough  in  camp  occasion  ally.    'Rosey'  greets  you  with  a  flash  of  dazzling  teeth,  and  a  cheerful,  ""Mornin',  Missus  '  and  is  no  whit  disconcerted  by  the  fact  that  her  head  is  bandaged  in  a  dirty,  blood  stained  rag,  one  eye  blackened  -well,  that  is  hardly  a  suitable  term-let  us  say,  'invalided'  -  and  her  first  and  second  fingers  split  apart.   Inquiries  elicit  the  fact  that  'Car'line'  has  been  making  scandlous  eye  at  Rosy's  mur  ree'  (blackfellow),  or,  maybe  vice  versa.   Anyhow,  a  yam  stick  or  two  havve  been  picked  upon  to  settle  all  differences,  and  Rosy,  being  the  smaller,  is  decidedly  the  worse  for  wear.    She  takes  the  fortune  of  war  in  a  philosophical  fashion,  however  and,  with  the  injured  hand  bound  up  is  prepared  to  go  on  with  her  work  as  usual   With  regard  to  the  gins,  two  things  are  undesirable.    Don't  have  them  living  at  the  homestead,  and  draw  the  line  at  piccanin  nies  about  the  kitchen.    the  first  is  seldom  a  success,  and  is  far  better  not  attempted.  The  women  work  all  the  better  for  the  few  hours'  freedom  at  night,  at  it  constantly,  they  are  apt  to  turn  sulky  .    As  for  the  picca  ninnies,  tlhey  are  most  fascinating  little  creatures,  and  always  ready  to  make  friends.  At  first  it  is  rather  her  amusing  to  have  a  little,  ragged  creature  steal  to  one's  side  and  beg  for  ""plums  "".    But  by  and  by  it  be  comes  father  a  nuisance,  especially  if  they  take  to  making  private  excursions  to  the  cake  box,  or  the  biscuit  barrel,  in  the  din   ngroom.   Everyone  has  her  own  way  of  managing  her  gins,  and  round  here  it  is  quite  a  com  mon  thing  for  a  lazy  one  to  receive  personal  chastisement  at  the    hands  of  her  mistress  and  occiasionally  an  even  more  severe  form  from  '  the  boss""  and  a  stick.    This  is  'old  style'  and  curiously  enough  the  niggers  seldom  resent  it.    Now  and  then  a  gin  so  punished  will  depart  for  good  and  all,  but,   as  a  rule  if  they  leave  at  all,   they  invariably  drift  back  again  in  the  course  of  a  week  or  so,  and  return  to  work  as  though  nothing  had  happened.    For  my  part,  I  could  never  bring  myself  to  touch  a  woman,  either  black  or  white  and  in  all  lmy  experience  I  have  never  but  once  had  the  least  trouble  ,In  that  case  the  girl,  who  was  living  in  the  house  turned  sulky,  and  finally  departed  to  the  camp  for   good   As  to  their  qualifications.    They  can  be  taught  to  cook,  they  wash  scrub  and  iron  to  perfection  and  excel  in  cleaning  silver  and  brasses,  boots  and  knives.  Add  to  this  that  they  are  silent  in  their  move  ments,  generally  clean  in  person,  and  obedi  ent,  and  never  saucy,  and  careful  with  croc   kery.    Lastly,  they  are  extremely  trust  worthy  with  childiren,  and  make  the  kindest  of  nurses,   Of  course,  they  are  human,  and  have  tempers  but  my  experlence  is  that  the  more  like  white  women  you  treat  them,  the  less  trouble  you  will  have.

"Aboriginal  Anthropology.   The  expedition  for  the  investigation  of  the  manners  and-  customs  of  ithe  aborigines  of  Central  Australia,  whioh  is  about  to  start  under  the  leadership  of  Professor  Bald  win  Spencer,  of  tho  Melbourne  Univer-   sity,  and  Mr.  F.  J.  Gillen,  one  of  the  South  Australian  Inspectors  of  Aborigines,  is  oneof  those  intrepid  exploits  with  which-  the  history  of  science  hbounds.  The  idea  originated  from  a  body  of  English  scientists,  who,  in  their  ethnological  and  anthropological  gourmanderie,  possess  an  insatiable  uppotito  for  the  fruits  of  any  unex  plored  field,  no  matter  where  it  be.  The  settlement  of  '  this  huge  continent,  -in  common  with  that  of  all  sea-girt  lands,  has  gradually  extended  from  the  coast  inland  so  that  within  measurable  distance  of  the  roar  of  the  breakers,  aboriginality  is  a  thing  that  has  already  faded  into  tho  twilight  of  fable.  It  has  therefore  (been  conceived  that  the  final  ohaptor—  the  ethnological  and  anthropological  reinanot.  so  to  speak—  of  the  aboriginal  history  of  Australia,  has  been  slowly  driven  to,  and  ooncoritred  in,  that  vast  unused  territory  which  is  termed  Central  Australia.  Just  as  the  various  tribce  of  North  ,  American  aboriginals  were  slowly  hemmed   in  by  '  air  implacable  civilisation  until,  like,  a  herd,  of  deer,  thoywero  forocd  to  break  cover,  and'oither  to  perish  beneath  tho  leaden  bail  or  to  yield  to'  conditions  whioh  ultimately  destroyed  them  as  surely  as  the  rifiee  of  the  Yengeeso    so)  it  is  considered  by  the  body  of  English  soiontiats  iiquostion,  all.  that  can  possibly  remain  of  what  is  aboriginal,  must  survive  in  that  awful  dosolation,  whore  the  cool  breezes  never  dream  -of  straying,  and  where  gales  that  fearlessly  sweep  im  measurable  oceans  hesitato  to  Invade.  The  first  question  in  conneotion  with  the  expedi  tion  was  the  inevitable  one  of  finance.  Eager  as  were  the  English  scientists  for  the  ethnological  and  anthropological'  roses  that  seemed  born  to  blush  unseen,  and  waste  their  sweetness  on  the  desert  air  of  Central  Australia,  tbey  were,'  strangely  enough,  soientifieally  oblivious  of  tho  ,  fact""  that  auoh  commonplaces  as  pack-horses,  wutor-  bags,  rations,  and  other  impedimenta,  are  .  essential  -  indispcnsables  of  such  explorations.  The  Melbourne  University  very  generously  granted  leave  of  absence  to  Professor  Spencer  on  full  pay,  and,  in  doing  so,  very  sensibly  und  justly  estoomed  that  it  bad  contributed  an  ample  share  towards  the  scientific  venture.  In  '  tbe  same  spirit  tho  South  Australian  Government  gave  Mr.  Gillen  carte  -blanche  for  the  necessary  period.  Tho  other  States  of  the  continent  were  then  '  looked  to  for  the  cash  necessary  to  equip  the  expedition.  .  But  the  different  Governments  of  those  remaining  States  seem  to  have  been  too  busy  in  adjusting  federal  finance  and  Other  trifles  to  bother  .about  anthropological  picnics  or  ethnological  junkets  —  soience  to  tho  contrary  notwithstanding.  .Tho  proposed  expedition  wns  on  tho  very  verge  of.  collapse,  when  Mr.  David  Syme,  tho  proprietor  of  the  Melboarno  Age,  generously  sub  scribed  £1,009,  which  is  almost  enough  to  satisfy  tho  whole  necessity.  In  a  short,  time,  therefore,  tho  expedition  is  to  start,  and,  in  such  competent  hands,  the  very  best  of  results  may  confidently  be  looked  forward  to.  .  .

'It  is  interest  ing  to  read  the  ""  Germania""  of  Tacitus,  the  ""  Gallic  War  ""  of  Ccesar,  an'd  the  many  other  histories,  anthropological  and  ethnological,  of  peoples  who  promised  (and  have  since  become)  to  bo  factors  in  human  history.  but  ""Gulli  ver's  Travels  ""  will  surely  survive  the  interest  and  practical  instruotion  .which  ten  thousand  treatises  from  the  pens  of  ten  thousand  ethnologists  and  anthropologists  on  central  Australia  can  ever  hope  to  achieve.  Unfor  tunately  beyond  the  grotesquerie  ,  and,  in  too  many  instances,  the  absolute  abhorrence  of  Australian  aborigiualities,  thcro  is  simply  nothing  to  bo  learned  except  that  ""Nature  bath  formed  strange  fellows  in  lier'  time.""

Each  of  the  former  class  of  spirits  carried  about  with  him  or  her  a  sacred  magic  stick,  called  a  cburinga,  wbicb  was  one  of  the  class  of  objects  that  might  never  be  seen  by  women  or  uninitiated  men.  Wheu  undergoing  reincarnation  the  spirit  dropped  the  chnringa,  and  as  soon  as  the  child  was  born  the  father  and  one   or  two  men  who  were  close  relatives  went  in  search  of  it,  end  if  they  did  not  find  it  one  was  made  out  of  the  ""  Nauja  ""  tree.  Very  often  the  original  churinga  was  found,  usually  by  the  child's  paternal  grandfather,  who  had  thoughtfully  provided  himself  with  one.  Every  man  and  woman  iu  the  tribe  was  represented  by  a  churinga  in  the  sacred  storehouse  of  the  local  group,  and  every  child  bore  as  its  secret  or  churinga  name  that  of  the  particular  ancestor  with  whom  the  old  men  of  the  tribe  after  consultation  had  identified  it.  The  women  never  kuew  their  sectet  names,  and  the  men  only  after  they  had  been  initiated.  No  sooner  did  a  boy  begin  to  go  about  in  the  bush  in  search  of  food  than  he  found  himself  considerably  restricted  as  to  whnt  lie  might  cat.  Through  fear  of  evil  magic  there  were  many  foods  which  ho  must  avoid.  Should  he  eat  kangaroo  tail  or  wild  turkey  or  its  eggs  be  would  become  prematurely  old.  Parrot  or  cocatoo  flesh  would  cause  the  growth  of  a  hollow  on  the  top  of  his  bead,  and  of  a  bole  under  his  chin.  Quail  nnd  ite  eggs  causcd  the  hair  nnd  whiskers  not  to  grow.  Any  part  of  the  englehawk  other  than  the  sinewy  legs  would  produce  leanness,  though  the  strong  legs  were  admirable,  as  they  improved  the  growth  of  tho  same  limb.  It  was  evident  that  there  was  at  once  a  desire,  by  means  of  sympathetic  magic,  to  strengthen  the  boy,  and  more  still  a  desire  to  take  advantage  of  the  strong  influence  of  magic,  so  as  to  reserve  the  best  entables  for  the  older  men.  Pointing-sticks  were  used  to  compass  the  death  of  an  enemy  after  an  in»  cantation  had  been  pronounced  over  them,  and  all  pains  and  aches  were  supposed  to  be  caused  by  a  special  form  of  pointing-stick  nsod  by  the  spirits,  and  called  an  ""  ullinka.  ""  Pointing-sticks  with  eagle-hawk  claws  were  supposed  to  bo  specially  efficacious,  as  tho  claws  would  grip  the   internal  organs  of  the  victim,  and  produce  great  pain.  A  potent  implement  of  magic  used  by  the  men,  all  of  whom  carried  one,  was  a  form  of  knowt  called  Ililika,  the  sight  of  which  was  quite  enough  to  recall  an  intractable  wife  to  a  state  of  submission.  Tho  stroke  of  an  ""  ililika  ""  was  firmly  bulieved  by  tho  women  to  be  followed  by  very  serious  results,  just  as  the  men  beliovcd  that  the  wound,  however  slight,  of  a  charmed  spoar  was  6ure,  unless  counteracted  by  strong  magic,  to  provo  fatal.  Australian  aboriginals  were  not  afraid  of  their  hair  coming  into  the  possession  of  otberB.  On  the  contrary,  it  was   their  duty  at  certain  timoB  to  cut  off  their  hair  for  tho  purpose  of  presenting  it  to  certain  individuals.  Every  native  wore—often  as  his  sole  article  of  clothing—a  girdlo  of  human  hair,  a  which  once  adorned  tho  head  of  hiB  a  mother-in-law.

"ABORIGINAL  RELIC.   An  aboriginal  romance  of  about  fifty  years  ago  has  boen  revived  by  a  request  from  the  Sydney  Museum  authorities  to  Mr.  Thomas  Camp  bell,  of  Burrendong,  for  possession  of  a  yellow-box  tree  growing  in  his  property,  and  curiously  carved  with  aboriginal  inscriptions.  The  tradi  tion  is  that  the  tree  marks  the  bur  ial  place  of  Lowrie,  a  famous  chief  amongst  the  Burrendong  blacks.  Ab  out  fifty  years  ago  Lowrie  went  (to  Mudgoc,  and  had  a  love  affair  with  a  young  lubra,  the  upshot  of  which  was  that  he  left  hurriedly,  with  the  fighting  men  of  the  Mudgoo  tribe  in  pursuit.

They  tire  gen  tle  creatures  about  the  house,  though  war-like  enough  in  camp  occasionally.  'Rosy'  greets  you  with  a  flash  of  daz  zling  teeth,  and'  a  cheerful,  -'Mornin1,  'Missus,'  and  is  no  whit  disconcerted  fry  !  the  fact  that  her  head  is  bandaged  in  a  dirty,  'blood-stained  rag,  one  eye  black  enied—  well,  that  is  .hardly  a'  suitaJMe  ?  term'  —  let  us  say,  'invalided'  —  and  her  first  and  second  fingers  split  apart.  1  Inquiries  elicit  the  fact  that  'Ca'r'iine'  has  l-een  making  scan'lous  ej-es  at  Rosev's  '?Mnnrree'  (black|fellow),  or,   maybe,  vicfi'Vensa'.,  Anyhow,  a  yain  stick  or  two  liave-l)eeu  picked  upon*  to  .s\?ttb  all  adiffcrences\  and  Rosy,  being  I  the  suvaller,  is  decidedly  the  worse  for  ,  wear.

With  regard  to  the  gins,  two  things  are  undesirable.  Don't  have  them:  living,  at.  the  homestead,  and  draw  the  line  at  j  piccaninuies  about  the  kitchen.

At  first  ,,?  it  is  rather  amusing1  to  have  a  little,  ragged  creature  steal  to  one's  side,  and  .  beg  for  ''plums.'  But-  by-and-iby  it  'be-  1  comes  rather  a  nuisance,  especially  if  they  take  to  inakiug  priva'te  excursions  ?  to  the  cake-box,  or  the  biscuit-barrel,-  in  the  diniugroaui.
