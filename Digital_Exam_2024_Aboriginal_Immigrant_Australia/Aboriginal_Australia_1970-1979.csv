"Aboriginal   rights   Sir,  —  Recently  I  visited  the  National  Aboriginal  Government  who  are  now  sitting  at  Capital  Hill,  and  it  is  my  opinion  that  these  members  of  an  oppressed  nation  are  more  than  justified  in  their  current   actions.   The  Aboriginal  people  are  fight-  ing  for  their  human  rights  as  a  nation  within  a  nation  —  for  they  have  never  relinquished  their  sov-  ereignty  over  this  land.  Yet  both  in  our  past  and  present  occupation  of  Australia,  we  have  denied  them  their  basic  land  rights  and  the  opportunity  to  administer  and  control  their  own  welfare  and  lifestyles.   One  of  the  main  demands  of  the   National  Aboriginal  Government  is  that  a  Federal  Bill  of  Rights  be  included  in  the  Federal  Constitution.  It  would  guarantee  the  Aboriginal  nation  compensation  for  being  alien-  ated  from  their  traditional  lands;  compensation  also  for  the  white  man's  interference  in  their  lives  as  Aboriginal  people.   This  Federal  Bill  of  Rights  would  also  guarantee  that  a  fixed  per-  centage  of  the  Gross  National  Prod-  uct  be  handed  over  to  an  Aboriginal  forum,  elected  by  Aboriginal  people,  enabling  them  to  administer  and  control  their  own  lives.   It  could  also  guarantee  that  tribal  Aboriginal  lands  and  the  property  rights  in  freehold  be  immediately   handed  to  the  traditional  owners.   I  would  strongly  support  that  such  a  Federal  Bill  of  Rights  be  in-  troduced  into  the  Federal  Constitu-  tion.  This  would  guarantee  the  Aboriginal  nation  their  basic  human  rights,  which  the  white  man  has  unforgivably  denied  them  in  the  past.

"Aboriginal   land   Sir,  —  Last  year  our  politicians  played  a  game  which  led  to  a  decision  by  an  Australian  Governor-General  in  his  own  right.  The  decision  was  a  weighty  one,  and  Australia  has  not  been  the  same  since  it  was  taken.           Through  the  fault  of  our   politicians  in  forcing  this  situa-  tion  upon  the  Governor-General,  and  hence  upon  us,  certain  sec-  tions  of  Australian  society  have  become  more  disturbed  than  others.   Much  of  this  disturbance  can  be  reduced  if  the  Australian  ""Crown""'  makes  yet  another  weighty  decision,  namely  the  recognition  in  retrospect  of  the  title  of  the  Australian  Aboriginal  people  to  their  land  in  the  18th  century,  albeit  in  a  way  foreign  to  Anglo-Saxon  concepts.   This  suggestion  need  not  upset  the  property  owners,  as  they  will  continue  to  own  the  im-  provements  upon  ""their""  land,  which  in  any  event  is  controlled  by  the  Crown.   Furthermore,  a  method  of  fun-  ding  developments  for  the  Aboriginal  people  of  Australia  is  inherent  in  the  suggestion.  Let  rent,  be  paid  to  the  Aboriginal  people  by  the  Commonwealth  of  Australia  for  every  improvement  that  has  been  made  upon  their  land,  and  let  the  Aboriginal  peo-  ple  be  freed  from  the  envy  of  their  European  fellows  because  of  so  called  ""handouts""  from  taxpayer's  money.   Above  all  let  us  take  this  op-  portunity  to  recognise  the  Australian  Aboriginal  people  as  people  in  their  own  right.   An  opportunity  such  as  this  may  not  exist  again,  but  if  it  is  taken  now  the  Australian  ""Crown""  may  be  able  to  right  one  of  the  major  wrongs  ever  in-  flicted  bv  a  British  one.

"Aboriginal   cause   Sir,  —  1  have  always  had  a  measure  of  admiration  and   sympathy  for  the  Aboriginal  and  his  plight  until  I  watched  David  Frost's  program  and  I  felt  it  eb  bing  away  by  the  minute.   Such  a  show*  which  could  have  done  so  much  for  the  Aboriginal  cause,  showed  them  up  instead  as  a  lot  of  ill-man  nered,  foul-mouthed  hooligans.   Mv  admiration  goes  to  David  Frost  for  civility  comparing  an  uncivil  show,  anil  to  Barrie  Dex  ter  for  keeping  his  cool  under  impossible  conditions.  The  only  point  Mr  Perkins  got  across  was  that  he  likes  to  run  with  the  hare  and  hunt  with  the  hounds.   So  there  has  been  injustice  in  the  past  —  of  course  there  has,  but  the  Aboriginal  people  are  not   alone  in  this.  It  was  an  injustice   for  a  vast  proportion  of  people,  to  be  transported  here  in  the  first  place  and  I  have  no  doubt  the  lash  hurts  a  white  back  as  much  as  it  does  a  black  one.

"Aboriginal  'embassy'   Sir,  —  The  argument  that  the  Aboriginal  ""embassy""  has  no  more  right  than  any  other  group  to  camp  in  front  of  Parliament  House  fails  to  deal  with  the  following  facts.   Firstly,  that  the  Aboriginal  people  have  more  right  than  any  other  group  in  the  Australian  community  to  camp  on  Aus-   tralian  land.   Secondly,  that  the  only  people  who  were  offended  by  the  pre-  sence  of  the  Aboriginal  embassy  were  the  members  of  the  Gov-   ernment.   Thirdly,  that  the  Aboriginal  embassy  was  quite  legal  when  it  was  set  up.  It  has  become  illegal  only  since  the  Government  rushed  through  a  special  ordin-  ance.  This  is  nothing  less  than  the  Government  using  the  law  for  its  own  political  ends.   RAYMOND  HAWKES  Turner.   Sir,  —  In  your  editorial  of  July  21,  'A  Turning  Point',  you  stated  that  the  destruction  of  the  Aboriginal  ""embassy""  may  .  .  .  prove  to  be  a  turning  point,  and  that  would  be  a  good  thing  in   deed"".   As  a  senior  citizen  of  Aus-  tralia  and  as  one  who  witnessed  the  eviction  from  the  Aboriginal  ""embassy""  on  July  20,  I  thoroughly  endorse  this  state-  ment.  I  consider  it  is  essential  for  all  Australians  to  see  that  it  does  become  a  turning  point  in  the  treatment  of  Aborigines.   You  further  state  that  if  Aus-  tralians  in  general  had  shown  much  more  than  sympathy  for  the  Aborigines,  ""enough  pres-  sure  would  have  been  put  on  the   Federal  Government  since  1967  to  achieve  the  actions  which  would  have  removed  the  need  for  a  protest  such  as  that  mounted  by  the  Aborigines  in  their  'embassy'.  ""   Well  let  us  all  exercise  such  pressure  now  so  that  the  pre-  sent  and  future  governments  will  treat  as  human  beings  and  full   citizens  people  who  should  have  rights  as  the  original  inhabitants  of  this  country.   S.  P.  LEWIS  Maroubra,  NSW.   Sir,  —  I  was  at  the  demon-  stration  outside  Parliament  House  on  Sunday  and  I  would  like  to  draw  your  attention  to  the  police  movie  camera  and  the  times  it  filmed.  The  camera  was  constantly  filming  as  the  marchers  arrived  at  Parliament  House,  as  they  sat  down  in  the   road  and  talked.   It  filmed  the  arrival  of  the  tent,  the  erection  of  the  tent  and  the  speeches  made  in  front  of  the  tent.  Then  it  ran  out  of  film  and  was  reloaded.   With  the  camera  fully  loaded,  the  police  moved  in  to  clear  away  the  tent  and  the  camera  took  no  more  movies.  There  were  a  number  of  people  arrested  and  a  number  of  scuffles  and  though  the  camera  was  in  an  ideal  position  to  film  these,  and  the  films  would  be  important  in  later  court  cases,  no  films  were  shot.   The  courts  are  thus  denied  what  might  be  important  evid-  ence.  If  the  police  have  nothing  to  hide  why  do  they  not  film  the  scuffles  and  arrests?   L.  F.  HARRIS  Turner.   Sir,  —  Australians  have  a  lot  to  answer  for,  the  Australian  Gov-  ernment  even  more  so,  for  what  took  place  last  Thursday  and  on  Sunday.  There  is  talk  among  the  Aborigines  now  of  retalia-  tions  and  ""consequences"".  I  do  not  blame  them  for  thinking  like  this,  in  view  of  the  oppres-  sion  over  the  last  200  years,  and  the  racist,  discriminatory  laws  which  still  exist,  the  latest  Tres-  pass  on  Commonwealth  Lands  Ordinance,  1972,  being  an  ex-  ample  of  this.  It  was  brought  in  to  make  illegal  the  most  success-  ful  and  peaceful  protest  yet  seen  in  Canberra.   Such  scenes  as  the  massacres  on  Thursday  and  on  Sunday  rival  some  from  South  Africa  for   racism  and  oppression  of  a  col-   oured  minority;  Australia  will  become  the  laughing  stock  of  the  world  and  well  the  nation  and  most  of  its  inhabitants  de-  serve  it.   LLEW  MORRIS  Director,  ANU  Abschol.  Acton.   Sir,  —  We  deplore  the  action  of  the  Federal  Government  in  forcibly  removing  the  peaceful  protesters  outside  Parliament  House.  No  purpose  has  been  served  by  this  action  beyond  a  reflection  of  the  perpetual  plight  of  the  first  and  continuously  dis-  possessed  Australians  in  their  homeland.  Even  the  Eskimos,  the  American  Indians  and  the  Maoris  have  a  place  to  call  their   own.   Dr  Coombs  said  recently  the   ill-treatment  of  Aborigines  had  caused  Australians  to  be  thought  of  as  racists  in  the  eyes  of  the  world.  We  do  not  think  that  this  will  have  caused  a  loss  of  a  minute's  sleep  to  a  great  many  white  Australians.   H.  E.  and  L.  J.  LEE  Kuala  Lumpur,  Malaysia.

I  doubt  that  a  day  passes  without  an  officer  in  the  depart-  ment  stating  that  he  would  be  quite  lost  without  his  secretary,  and  how  he  certainly  does  ap-  preciate  the  attention  he  gets  from  the  typists  but  it  obviously  is  purely  lip  service.  It  would  be  much  more  helpful,  and  cer-  tainly  much  more  appreciated,  if  he  would  lift  a  pen  and  voice  his  thoughts  through  your   column.

"Aboriginal   voice   Sir,  —  As  an  interested   Aboriginal  spectator  I  am  amazed  that  the  media  still  con-  tinues  to  dote  on  every  utter-  ance  my  countryman  Charles  Perkins  makes.  The  latest  from  Charles  is  that  he  is  going  to  return  to  his  position  as  Assist  ant  Secretary,  Department  of  Aboriginal  Affairs  and  that  in  his  opinion  the  Liberal  Party's  policies  on  Aboriginal  affairs  are  good.   I  don't  wish  to  debate  the  merits  of  these  two  utterances  except  to  express  my  personal  opinions  of  disappointment  in  the  man.   Last  year  the  Liberal-Nation-  al  Country  coalition  had  the  most  racist  policies  on  Abori-  ginal  affairs  in  Australia's  his-  tory,  according  to  Charlie.  The  year  before,  the  Labor  Party  was  bad  news.  Then  it  was  good  news.  Now  it's  forgotten.   Next  year  if  the  country  is  run  by  the  communists,  Charles  no  doubt  will  proclaim  it  to  be  the  greatest.   Whites  in  this,  country  of  course  are  not  fooled,  but  Charles  obviously  hasn't  read  the  mood  of  many  black  Australians.  We  are  beginning  to  see  Perkins  for  what  he  is;    an  unsophisticated,  undignified,  opportunist  who  has  turned  out  to  be  nothing  more  than  a  man-  ipulating  operator  who  swims  with  the  tide.   His  damming  condemnations  of  his  colleagues  in  the  upper  strata  of  the  department,  par-  ticularly  Barrie  Dexter,  the  Secretary  has,  in  my  opinion,  made  it  impossible  for  the  de-  partment  to  function  adequately  to  the  real  benefit  of  Aborigines  throughout  Australia.   Individual  power  struggles  and  little  games  do  not  take  precedence  over  the  unfortunate  plight  of  a  whole  race  of  people.   Mr  Dexter  in  my  opinion  is  a  good  and  honest  man  whose  integrity  and  performance  in  a  difficult  and  sensitive  area  es  capes  any  real  criticisms  from   me.   Whilst  Barrie  Dexter  may  not  have  any  say  in  his  return  to  the  department,  Charle's  behaviour  over  the  past  18  months,  will  effectively  prevent  other  Aboriginal  persons  within  the  Public  Service  from  receiv-  ing  accelarated  progression  within  the  service  to  the  same  extent  as  Charlie  had.   Dexter  would  be  crazy  to  let  it  happen  again.       And  so  to  the  media  I  say  leave  Charlie  alone.  We're  sick  of  hearing  what  he  says  or  does.       If  you  want  Aboriginal  opin-  ion,  go  to  the  north  and  seek  out  the  real  leaders.  If  you  want  to  project  our  real  image  have  northern  Aborigines  on  your  TV  programs  etc.   HARRY  PENRITH  Curtin.",102194386,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/102194386,Aboriginal voice,Article,1975-12-30,2,2,"Sir,—As an interested Aboriginal spectator I am amazed that the media still continues to dote on every",https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article102194386?searchTerm=aboriginal,11,The Canberra Times (ACT : 1926 - 1995),212.8011016845703,very relevant
"Aboriginal  advancement   Sir,  -—For  the  last  three  and  a  ,  half  years  I  have  been  partici   pating  in  a  community  develop  ment  programme  with  the  Abori  ginal  Advancement  Association  in  Bourke,  New  South  Wales.   ■  The  main  principle  of  com  ■  munity  development  is  to  find   out  what  are  'a  community's  health  needs,  and  to  get  discus  sion  going-about  these  needs  so  '  that  the  Aboriginal  people  them  selves  will  be  the  prime  movers   in  satisfying  their  wants  in-their   own  way.   After  this  has  happened  ,there  it  a  crucial  psychological  period  '  -  in  which  the  community  needs  to   have  the  wherewithal  to  imple  ment  their  decisions.  If  their  -  plans  are  blocked  because;  of  a   lack  of  funds  in  addition  to  all  '  the  other  local  difficulties  that   ■■  they  will  usually'  encounter""  then  -  the  community  is  likely  to  lose   its  impetus  and  become  discour-    aged   For  '  good  historical  reasons  Aborigines  expect  the  majority  culture  to  let  them  down.  During    the  last  two  years  the  Aborigines   in  Bourke  have  become  more   confident  in  making  their  own   decisions  because  they  have    .  learnt  that  they  can  expect  the  |sympathetic  support  of  the  office  of  Aboriginal  Affairs  and  that  men  like  Mr-Dexter,  Dr  Coombs    and  Mr  Bryant  are  to  be  trusted.  The  money  that  has  come  into  community  for  development  projects  has  made  the  Aboriginal  Advancement  Association  into  a   group  with  some  small  economic  say  in  the  total  community.  This      newfound  control  over  their  own   affairs  has  made  the  Aboriginal,  reconsider  his  self-,  view  as  one  of  the  ""lowest  of  the  low"",  and  feel  that  at  last  he  has  some  hope  of  achieving  parity  with  the  dominant  society.   Money  spent  on  helping  Aborigines  to  help  themselves  is  a  logical  investment  long  over  looked  by  Australian  Govern   ments.   By  the  very  nature  of  the  principle  that  Aboriginal  deve  lopment  must  come  from  the  Aborigines  themselves  and  that  they  are  inexperienced  in  mat  ters  of  business,  it  is  only  to  be  expected  that  some  projects  will   fail.   It  is  probably  more  realistic  to  balance  these  failures  (or  wasted  moneys)  against  the  suc  cesses  (or  good  investments)  that  are  being  achieved.  Com  pared  say,  with  the  Fill  saga,  the  amount  of  taxpayers'  money   wasted  will  be  small.  However,  the  gains  for  Aborigines  in  human  dignity  and.  so  for  the  dignity  of  Australia  as  a  whole,  will  be  large.   The  recent  upward  mobility  of  Aborigines  in  general  has  dis  turbed  the  status  quo  of  many  rural  areas  and  led  to  some  re  sentment  by  the  dominant  white  society.   It  will  be  a  tragic  misunder  standing  of  the  way  in  which  a  community  develops  if  those  po   litical  representatives  of  the  white  blacklash  arc  successful  in  destroying  this  impetus  to  com  munity  development.  The  pater  nalism  of  the  settlement  mana  ger  will  be  no  less  choking  if  his  role  is  taken  over  by  the  ob  sessional  accountant.   (Dr)  M.

"Aboriginal   voice   Sir,  —  Does  Harry  Penrith  (Letters,  December  30),  realise   what  he  has  done?   He  has  played  straight  into  the  hands  of  those  many  white  Australians  who  have  long  decried  Charles  'Perkins  as  a  racist,  a  radical,  a  trouble  maker,  a  stirrer  .  .  .  and  so  on.

Whether  we  like  it  or  not,  we  are  fully  aware,  now.   As  one  of  the  most  reported   —  and  mis-reported  —  people  in  Australia,  Charles  Perkins  has  never  had  the  advantage  of  a  press  secretary,  speechwriter  or  public  relations-man.

"Aboriginal  deaths   THE  deaths  of  seven  more  Aboriginal  babies  from  a  squalid  unemployed  camp  at  Camooweal,  north-west  Queensland,  have  evoked  the   usual  obscene  spectacle  of  inter-governmental  buckpass-  ing.  Federal  and  State  Govern  ments  and  the  Mt.  Isa  Shire  Council  all  blame  each  other  for  neglect  of  conditions  that  they  have  all  known  about  for  months.  Avon  Downs  and  Soudan  Stations  in  the  Northern  Ter  ritory,  from  which  some  of  the  people  were  driven,  have  now  been  brought  into  the  picture.  Because  of  the  temporary  publicity  spotlight,  a  little  action  by  one  authority  or  an  other  may  be  expected  in  north-west  Queensland.  But  Camooweal  is  only  a  microcosm  of  the  Aboriginal  situation  throughout  Austra  lia.  Last  year,  Nancy  Young,  of  CuruiamuUa,  had  to  serve  time  before  sympathetic  medical  evidence  proved  her  baby  to  have  died  not  from  neglect,  but  from  poverty  caused  malnutrition.  This,  as  the  Queensland  Institute  of  Medical  Research  points  out  year  after  year,  is  the  basic  reason  why  the  rate  of  Aboriginal  child  deaths  ex  ceeds  that  of  the  total  Aus  tralian  population.  All  Governments  and  all  employers  share  responsibility  for  the  condition  of  Austra  lian  Aborigines.  So  do  all  white  racists  —  no  matter  what  class  they  come  from.   The  Camooweal  babies  may  not  have  died  quite  in  vain  if  this  latest  example  engenders  a  bit  stronger  support  for  the  basic  claims  of  the  Aborigines  —  full  equality,  full  social  ser  vices,  special  help  in  trade  and  other  training,  compensa  tion  for  the  years  of  near  slavery  and,  above  all,  the  right  to  run  their  own  affairs  on  their  own  lands.

"Aboriginal  rights    Sir,  ---  to  the  letter   by  Peter  Hughes  (The  Canberra  Times,  November  30).  The  existing  Aboriginal  special  schools  are  equal  to  apartheid,  lhe  curriculum  is  designed  not  to  stimulate  or  develop  the  intellect  of  the  child  to  its  fullest  potential,  nor  to  present  subjects  relevant  to  the  children's  life  style  or  cultural  background,  but  is,  in  fact,  designed  to  foist  on  to  these  children  the  maximum   amount  of  white  culture  and  mechamcal  skills  (writing  etc)  at  the  least  possible  cost  to  the  Government.  Students  require  a  period  of  study  at  ""post-  primary""  schools  to  bridge  the  gap  between  primary  level  and  high  school.   The  end  product  which  the  special  educational  system  pro-  duces  are  mainly  detribalised,  white-oriented,  poorly  educated  people,  capable  of  performing  manual  labour  and  signing  the   boss's  receipt  book  on  pay  days.  Those  rare  people  who  sur-  vive  the  special  schools  system     and,after  16-18  years  as   students,  are  then  capable  of     better  employment,  such  as  mechanics  and  typists.  Where  are  the  Aboriginal  doctors,  the   lawyers  and  the  fully  qualified   Aboriginal  teachers?   With  reference  to  reserve   lands  (Letters,  November  23),  Dr  Hughes  has  again  tried  to  mislead  the  public.  All  Ab-  original  reserves  are  in  fact   Crown  land  designated  as   Aboriginal  reserves.  Should  white  interests,  such  as  mining  companies,  occupy  reserve  land,  such  land  continues  to  be  designated  as  reserve.   However,  instances  can  be  quoted  of  Aboriginal  people  wishing  to  occupy  and  develop  land  classified  as  a  reserve,  from  which  the  original  occupants  nave  been  removed,  either  by  economic  pressure  or  eviction  only  to  be  told  that  the  land  has  been  reclassified  and  is  no  longer  a  reserve  area.   The  Government  claims  that  a  reserve  ceases  to  be  a  reserve  when  not  in  use  or  occupied.   Maps  available  from  the  shire  council  offices  at  Bermagui  show  1,700  acres  at  Wallaga  Lake  as  original  reserve  land,  The  Gov-  ernment  claims  the  reserve  area  is  135  acres.  The  people  are   using  and  occupying  only  11   acres.    By  the  Government's  own  definition,  only  11  acres  can  be   reserve.   The  Aboriginal  people  have  no  knowledge  of  borders  or  boundaries  and  when  the  Gov-  ernment  subtracted  17  acres  of  the  choicest  land  at  the  lake     now  the  site  of  some  20  white-owned  holiday  cottages,  and  added,  a  similar  acreage   ""back  in  the  bush  somewhere""  the  people  were  not  informed  as   to  its  location.   Quite  literally,I  say    to  Dr  Hughes    that  the  Aboriginal   people  do  want  to  know  just   where  the  reserves  are.   Using  the  Government's  definition  of  when  a  reserve  is  not,  a.  reserve,  actual  reserve  lands  in  the  whole  of  Australia  could  not  be  more  than  a  few  thousand  acres.  On  the  other  hand,  officially  designated  re-   serves  are  shrinking  alarmingly   in  the  fertile  eastern  States.   Adding  a  few  thousand  square  miles  of  desert  in  the  Northern  Territory  will  not  help  the  Aborigines  in  NSW,  where  re-  serves  have  shrunk  from  11,  000   acres  to  5,500  acres  in  six  years.   For  Dr  Hughe's  information,   I  have  had  ""consultation"",  or  as   I  prefer  to  say,I  have  talked   with  Aborigines  from  all  over   Australia  and  have  travelled  in   the  eastern  States  and  as  far  as  Alice  Springs.  I  do  know  the  at-  titudes  of  these  people  to  land   rights  and  other  Aboriginal  issues.  I  do  not  claim  to    to  represent   Aborigines,  only  to  be  sup-   ported  by  many  of  them.  The   Aboriginal  people  will  only  have  representatives  when  they   are  able  to  vote  for  reserved  black  seats  in  Parliament.   How  many  Aborigines  does  Dr  Hughes  represent?

Sir,  -  Anyone  who  saw  the  ABC  program  'A  Big  Country'  on  Thursday  Novem-  ber  23,  which  starkly  revealed  the  hopeless  situation  of  the  Aborigines,  would  not  be  human  if  he  or  she  did  not  feel  a  seething  anger  and  a  bitter  re-  sentment  towards  a  Government  that  has  enjoyed  23  years  of  uninterrupted  rule.   The  churches  of  this  land  raise  an  occasional  plaintive  cry  on  these  matters  but  sadly  they  are  pathetically  half-hearted.  The  Church  could  and  should  nag  consistently  and  loudly  at  the  national  conscience  and  more  specifically  at  the  national  Government,  if  only  to  prove  that  they  really  do  believe  in  the  teachings  of  Christ.   As  they  fail  quite  miserably  in  this  area  (they  appear  terri  fied  at  any  hint  of  Church  radicalism  and  defensive  to  the  point  of  impotence)  sadly  they  can  only  be  dismissed  as  irrele-  vant,  which  brings  us  back  to  those  guardians  and  rulers  of  our  nation  for  the  past  23  years  -  the  Liberal-Country  Party   coalition.   Question:  Can  any  member  of  the  Government  stand  with  head  erect  and  claim  to  have  done  his  best  for  a  once  proud  race  of  people,  or  indeed  any  thing  at  all  worth  recording?  The  answer  screams  at  us.   The  last  quarter  of  a  cen-  tury  is  an  indictment  against  our  rulers,  comprising  a  shame  they  will  have  to  carry  for  ever;  what  a  tragic  waste  of  an  opportunity  to  restore  dignity  and  pride!   In  so  many  ways  this  affluent,  lucky  land  of  ours  could  lead  the  world  illustrating  to  others  the  innovations  and  imagination  that  Australia  so  badly  needs.  Instead  the  McMahon  Govern-  ment  defends  itself  on  every   count  whilst  bombarding  us  with  abusive,  negative  rhetoric  against   the  ALP.   We  have  the  Churches  on  the  one  hand  resting  in  complacent  peace  and  a  Government  .on  the  other  that  is  callous,  arrogant  and  morally  bankrupt.   Sir,  this  Government  must  go  -  it  is  up  to  us.  I  close  with  the  words  of  Omar  Khayyam:   Ah  Love!  Could  you  and  I  with   fate  conspire   To  grasp  this  sorry  Scheme  of   Things  entire,   Would  we  not  shatter  it  to  bits   and  then   Re-mould  it  nearer  to  the   Heart's  desire.

"Aboriginal   rights   Sir,  -  As  an  ""Australian""  of  European  origin,  I  am  aware  that  .I  see  the  contact  between  the  Aus  tralians  and  the  English  in  the  18th  century  from  a  perspective  differing  somewhat  from  that  of  most  of  my  contemporaries.   Since  March  IS,  1976,  when  an  offer  to  use  part  of  my  house  (made  on  December  2,1975),  was  accepted  by  representatives  of  the  National  Aboriginal  Consultative  Committee,  my  awareness  of  the  inherent  re  sistance  to  ""new  Australians""  values  by  descendants  of  the  original  Aus  tralians  has  been  brought  to  a  high  pitch.   In  this  context  I  see  the  present   situation  faced  by  the  Australians  of  Aurukun  and  Mornington  Island,  in  relation  to  the  conflict  between  the  Governments  of  Queensland  and  ""The  Commonwealth  of  Australia""  as  of  special  significance.   I  do  not  believe,  for  example,  that  the  decision  of  the  Privy  Council  (which  overturned  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Queensland  in  favour  of  the  Australians  of  Aurukun),  handed  down  on  January  26,  was  made  public  on  that  date  by   coincidence.   Eric  Koo'oila,  an  elder  of  the  Wikmunkan  tribe,  and  until  recently  a  member  of  the  Aurukun  Shire  Council,  invited  me  to  visit  Aurukun  recently.  This  I  did  between  July  26  and  August  1,  and  I  met  many  of  the  people  there.   Eric  explained  to  me  the  moral  situation  of  his  people,  namely  that   they  have  never  been  dealt  with  as  free  people.  He  compares  his  people  with  the  roots  of  a  tree  which  are  embedded  in  the  land,  and  our  people  with  the  leaves  which  come  and  go.   My  own  knowledge  of  Australian  history  shows  that  no  war  was  ever  declared  by  the  English  against  the  Australians,  that  no  treaties  were  ever  made  by  the  English  Crown  with  any  Australian  tribe,  and  that  the  Australians  and  their  descen  dants  were  left  in  ""limbo""  from  1788  to  the  present  day.   Surely  it  is  time  for  all  concerned,  including  the  English  Crown,  to  make  some  ""treaty""  arrangement  with  the  Australians  to  relieve  the  tensions  of  the  Aurukun  type,  that  exists  throughout  Australia?

"Aboriginal   equality   Sir,  —  The  recent  Aboriginal  uprising  has  caused  considerable  consternation  among  the  -white  Australian  population,  which  sees  it  as  the  revolt  of  the  minor  ity  to  resist  the  masses.   Is  it  not  time  that  we.  the  so   called  unprejudiced  race  of  people  who  are  the  white  masses,  cast  aside  our  contemptable  atti  tude  of  racism  in  an  honest  ef  fort  to  see  and  thus  understand  the  black  Australians'  problems?   In  view  of  the  fact  that  we  like  to  consider  ourselves  as  an  unprejudiced,  free-and-easy  race,  scounful  of  racism,  as  is  proved  in  our  disapproval  of  the  treat  ment  of  the  South  African  blacks,  1  feel  that  the  attitude  of  our  community  in  saying  ""be'  ware  of  the  .  black  man""  has  a  high  degree  of  irony  attached  to   it.   In  many  other  nations,  in  both  modern  and  ancient  times,  the  suppression  of  the  minority  has  led  to  a  complete  revolt  of  those  suppressed.  It  should  be  seen  and  noted  that  because  we  are  Australian  does  not  mean  that  this  will  not  happen  to  us.   The  racial  problem  in  Austra  lia  is  already  an  explosive  situ  ation,  and  any  further  suppres  sion  must  lead  to  the  general  re  volt  of  the  Aboriginal  people.  Aboriginal  pride  and  honour  cannot  be_  cast  aside  for  the  sake  of  the  white  Australian  pride.

"Aboriginal  Embassy   CANBERRA:  The  Aboriginal  Embassy  here,  which  has  been  the  centre  of  worldwide  publicity  and  has  become  a  symbol  of  Black  resistance  throughout  Australia,  last  week  announced  plans  for  restructuring  to  enable  its  continued   existence  and  progress  during  the  ex  tremely  cold  winter  months  now  ap  proaching.

"ABORIGINAL  RIGHTS.   A  group  of  Aborigines  has  been  camped  on  Capital  Hill  for  about  two  weeks.  The  group  is  representative  of  the  Organisation  for  Aboriginal  Unity.  What  they  are  working  for  is  set  out  below:  A  Federal  Aboriginal  Bill  of  Rights  that  is  included  in  the  Federal  Constitution  that  guarantees  to  Aboriginal  people  the  following  —  1.  All  traditional  lands  where  they  can  be  shown  to  be  such  be  presented  as  tribal  Aboriginal  lands  and  the  property  rights  in  freehold  of  such  lands  be  handed  over  immediately  to  the  traditional  owners.  2.  All  traditional  sacred  sites  be  acknowledged  as  such  and  they  also  be  handed  to   the  traditional  keepers  of  the  sacred  sites.  3.  All  grounds  where  massacres  occurred  of  Aboriginal  people  at  the  time  of  colon-  isation  be  presented  as  Aboriginal  Memorials.  4.  All  mission  stations  and  reserves  now  inhabited  by  Aboriginal  people  or  at  one  stage  presented  as  such  under  state  law  be  handed  over  to  the  inhabitants  of  these  reserves  and  mission  stations.  5.  Cash  compensation  be  paid  to  Aboriginal  people  who  have  been  alienated  from  their  traditional  lands  by  the  invading  occupiers.  6.  Compensation  be  paid  to  Aboriginal  people  for  the  interference  with  their  right  to  life  as  Aboriginal  people,  their  culture,  their  religion,  their  language  and  of  the  inability  to  pass  on  their  laws.  7.  We  demand  that  a  fixed  percentage  of  the  national  gross  product  be  handed  over  to  an  elected  Aboriginal  forum  elected  by  Aboriginal  people  to  administer  and  control  the  welfare  and  lifestyle  of  Aboriginal  people  in  the  future.  Finally,  it  is  most  important  that  this  percentage  of  the  national  gross  produce  be  a  fixed  percentage  that  is  not  touched  by  either  major  political  parties  but  at  all  times  must  be  kept  in  accordance  with  any  adjustment  that  inflation  would  cause.

"ABORIGINAL  CONGRESS   The  National  Aboriginal  Congress  has  decided  on  strongly  socialistic  policies  for  black  affairs,  and  has  delivered  to  Federal  Cabinet  its  revised  constitution  with  a  clear  message  —  it  will  no  longer  be   dictated  to  by  white  politicians  and  administrators.  At  their  most  recent  meeting  (in  Canberra  from  March  24-29)  the  41  Congressmen  and  women  put  aside  personal  and  political  differences  and  united  in  defiance  of  the  barely  disguised  threats,  bribes  and  patronising  attitudes  which  have  been  their  lot  since  formation  last  November.  Although  leaving  room  for  negotiation  on  the  terms  fof  its  constitution,  the  Congress  has  told  the  Minister  for  Aborig-  inal  Affairs,  Senator  Jim  Cavanagh,  that  it  expects  Cabinet  to  grant  major  concess-  ions.  In  financial  terms,  the  NAC's  immed-  iate  objectives  are  control  of  the  $1.3  million  allotted  for  salaries  and  a  secretar-  iat,  and  control  of  the  $9  million  capital  development  fund  for  grants  to  Aborig-  inal  self-help  enterprises.  Amongst  other  things,  the  constitut-  ion  would  give  the  NAC  power  to:  Provide  a  single  representative  forum  for  the  expression  of  Aboriginal  desires;  Secure  and  control  Aboriginal  assets  and  decide   this  year's  May  Day  celebrations.  The  invitation  was  issued  by  the  Sydney  May  Day  Committee  and  Beatriz  Allende  is  expected  to  arrive  on  April  24.1  Beatriz  worked  closely  with  her  father  President  Allende  of  Chile,  for  the  three  years  prior  to  his  murder  and  the  fascist  military  coup  in  Chile.  Her  visit  to  Australia  will  help  to  develop  consciousness  and  action  for  the  release  of  thousands  of  political  prisoners  still  being  held,  tortured  and  murdered  in  Chilean  prisons.  It  can  also  develop  solid-  arity  with  Chilean  revolutionaries  in  their  struggle  to  overthrow  the  military  junta.  Speaking  at  an  interview  in  Havana  in  October  last  year,  Beatriz  Allende  said:  ""What  we  must  look  for  in  Chile  (in  the  future)  is  what  is  already  happening,  though  with  stronger  and  more  effective  organisation:  armed  struggle  against  fascism,  until  it  is  destroyed.  Fortunately,  I  have  received  information  that  large  parts  of  the  leadership  and  organisation  are  intact  and  are  forming  a  revolutionary  unit  that   and  implement  decisions  as  to  their  use;  Control  and  distribute  assets  including  moneys  appropriated,  received  or  accumulated  by  the  congress  from  any  source  for  the  benefit  or  use  of  Abor-  iginals;  Negotiate  for  and  receive  from  governments  full  and  proper  compensation  to  the  Aboriginals  and  grants  for  their  development;  Consult  and  liase  with  and  seek  advice  and  assistance  from  Federal,  State  and  local  governments  and  other  bodies  concerned  with  or  interested  in  Aboriginal  affairs  and  Develop,  promote  and  preserve  Aboriginal  languages  and  cultures.  Cavanagh  told  the  media  that  he  would  present  the  revised  constitution  to  Cabinet,  ""but  in  its  present  form  I  will  not  support  it,"".  Earlier,  Cavanagh  told  the  Congress  that  the  revised  constitution  gave  too  much  power  to  the  ministers.  ""It  could  lead  to  rule  by  a  junta,""  he  said.  The  NAC's  information  officer  and  member  for  metropolitan  Melbourne,  Bruce  McGuiness,  in  an  interview  with  Tribune,  explained  the  constitution.  ""Cavanagh  could  easily  apply  the  term  junta  to  his  own  Cabinet,""  said  McGuiness.  ABORIGINAL  LAWN  EMBASSY  An  issue  raised  early  in  the  week  was  the   grows  stronger  every  day.  I  believe  that  we  must  look  for  a  prolonged  war  of  liber-  ation  against  a  fascist  army  that  acts  like  an  army  of  occupation  in  its  own  land.""

LEFT  CHALLENGE  IN  FRANCE  The  sudden  death  of  Gaullist  Presid-  ent  Georges  Pompidou  last  week  has  thrown  the  French  political  scene  into  turmoil.  The  Gaullists  are  disunited.  Jacques  Chaban-Delmas,  the  candidate  of  the  Gaullist  Party,  the  UDR  (Democratic  Union  for  the  Republic),  does  not  have  the  unanimous  support  of  his  party.  While  adopting  a  ""modernist""  stance,  he  has  been  affected  by  a  tax  scandal  which  resulted  in  Pompidou  being  forced  to  remove  him  from  the  premiership  in  1972.  The  other  possible  rightwing  candid-  ate  is  Finance  Minister  Valery  Giscard  D'Estaing.  He  is  however  an  Independent  Republican  and  not  a  member  of  the  UDR  which  is  unlikely  to  back  him.  In  contrast  to  the  Gaullists,  the  Left  is  united  around  Francois  Mitterrand,  leader  of  the  Socialist  Party  and  candidate  of  the  Popular  Front  based  on  the  S.P.  and  the  Communist  Party.  Mitterrand  won  45%  of  the  vote  against  de  Gaulle  in  1965  while  last  year,  the  Popular  Front  won  46%  in  the  Assembly  elections,  deadheating  with  the  Gaullists.  With  inflation  running  at  13%,  unempl-  oyment  creeping  upwards  once  more  and  a  volatile  workers'  movement,  the  scene  may  be  set  for  a  left  victory  in  the  presidential  elections  next  month.  The  Common  Program  of  the  SP-CP   Aboriginal  Embassy,  the  tent  pitched  on  the  lawns  outside  Parliament  House.  v  Cavanagh,  in  the  first  public  admission  that  the  Government  is  embarrassed  by  the  embassy's  presence,  offered  a  bribe.  Take  away  the  embassy,  he  told  the  Congress,  and  Cabinet  will  consider  estab-  lishing  a  permanent  NAC  secretariat  in  Canberra.  A  similar  offer  had  been  made  earlier  by  the  McMahon  government.  The  Congress  didn't  bite.  ""Firstly,""  said  McGuiness,  ""we  told  Cavanagh  that  the  embassy  wasn't  our  decision,  it  was   coalition  proposes  a  number  of  social  reforms  advancing  ""renewed  democracy""  as  their  goal.  As  the  popularity  of  the  Gaullist  regime  has  slumped  in  recent  months,  however,  the  French  Right  has  issued  warnings  that  they  would  not  hesitate  to  launch  a  military  coup  if  a  Chile-type  situation  arose  in  France.  French  workers  and  students  on  the  other  hand,  are  likely  to  interpret  a  left  victory  at  the  polls  as  a  signal  to  push  ahead  with  their  demands  and  move  for  radical  change  in  French  society.   —  D.F.   S.A.L.C.  PLANS  NATIONAL  DEMONSTRATIONS  The  Labor  Government's  decision  to  shift  QANTAS's  African  head  office  from  Johannesburg  to  Mauritius  and  the  reported  decision  to  open  a  direct  air  link  between  Australia  and  East  Africa  (via  Mauritius)  are  important  first  steps  in  lessening  relations  with  the  racist  regimes  in  southern  Africa.  The  Australian  government  still  maintains  trade  centres  in  South  Africa,  however,  and  has  not  taken  any  measures  to  curb  the  booming  trade  between  the  two  countries.  (Trade  with  South  Africa  rose  by  $20  million  last  year).  Nor,  despite  the  conflict  with  Portugal  over  off-shore  oil  rights  in  the  Timor  Sea,  have  any  measures  been  taken  to  stop  trade  with  Portuguese  colonies,  or  the  use  of  QANTAS  and  TAA  flights  to  transport  Portuguese  military  personnel  to  and  from  Timor.  The  Australian  government  still  has  not  recognised  the  Republic  of  Guinea-  Bissau,  proclaimed  by  the  liberation  forces  in  September  last  year,  despite  the   up  to  the  Blacks  that  put  it  there  whether  or  not  to  take  it  down.  ""But  we  knew  they  didn't  want  to,  so  we  voted  to  support  its  existence.  The  embassy  is  a  constant  reminder  that  Blacks  want  land  rights  and  until  satisfactory  land  compensation  is  achieved,  only  force  can  bring  it  down.""  ""DIVIDE  AND  RULE""  FAILS  McGuiness  said  that  the  unity  shown  by  Congress  members  over  the  terms  of  the  constitution  and  their  refusal  to  water  down  the  document  showed  that  attempts  by  the  white  establishment  to  divide  and  rule  had  failed.  ""And  I  don't  think  such  attempts  will  be  made  again  -  I  believe  we've  won  respect  because  of  our  unity,""  he  said.  ""Of  course,  there  was  some  dissent  amongst  members.  We  are  a  group  of  people  with  widely  divergent  political  backgrounds  and  beliefs.  ""A  few  members  who  took  a  conservative  stand  on  policy  have  had  extremely  conser-  vative  attitudes  built  into  them,  especially  those  from  church  missions  and  so  on.""  NAC  sub-committees  presented  Cavanagh  with  submissions  on  health  and  education,  land  rights,  communications  and  language  and  culture.  ""The  submissions  were  almost  all  soc-  ialistically  inclined  and  represented  a  radical  departure  from  conventional  capitalist  concepts  of  community  service,""  said  McGuiness.  ""For  instance,  the  health  submission  ignored  the  white  concept  of  dishing  out  medicine  to  a  line  of  patients.  ""Black  health  centres  established  according  to  our  submission  would  establish  as  far  as  possible,  black  community  invol-  vement  and  a  sense  of  community  based  on  purpose  and  practice.""  Federal  Cabinet  will  soon  decide  whether  to  accept  or  reject  the  NAC's  demands.  Feeling  among  ministerial  advisors  and  departmental  officials  is  that  the  demands  will  largely  be  rejected,  with  compromise  proposals  substituted.  A  major  rebuff  to  the  NAC  over  its  constitution  would  be  a  setback  for  Australia's  Blacks.  In  terms  of  political  prestige  and  ideological  worth,  a  denial  of  the  NAC's  rights  would  be  disastrous  for  the  Labor  Party.  fact  that  the  Republic  has  been  recognised  by  over  75  countries.  The  Sydney  Southern  African  Liber-  ation  Centre  (SALC)  together  with  Melbourne  and  Adelaide  anti-apartheid  groups  is  planning  nationwide  demon-  strations  on  Africa  Freedom  Day,  June  26,  to  press  for  aid  to  the  African  liberation  movements  and  other  demands  covered  above.

VICTORY  FOR  PATHET  LAO  The  establishment  of  a  coalition  gov-  ernment  in  Laos,  with  equal  representation  of  the  Lao  liberation  forces  and  the  Royal  Lao  regime,  and  the  arrival  of  Prince  Soup-  hanouvong  in  Vientiane  marks  a  major  victory  for  the  liberation  forces.  After  years  of  armed  struggle,  the  Lao  people  now  have  the  chance  for  real  social  control  and  economic  progress.  The  Pathet  Lao  forces  control  four-fifths  of  the  country  and  form  the  predominant  social  and  political  force  in  the  country.  The  application  of  the  Lao  peace  agree-  ment,  which  has  only  been  possible  because  US  imperialism  has  accepted  the  reality  of  its  defeat  in  the  country,  contrasts  with  the  refusal  of  the  Thieu  regime  in  Saigon  to  implement  the  Vietnam  Peace  Agreement  and  the  massive  US  military  and  financial  aid  which  allows  Thieu  to  continue  the  war.  The  fact  that  the  peace  agreement  could  be  carried  out  in  Laos  after  some  delay,  and  yet  is  blocked  in  Vietnam  shows  clearly  that  the  fault  lies  with  the  Thieu  regime  and  US  imperialism.

"Aboriginal   welfare   Sir.  -  Now  that  the  initial  and  final  furores  focusing  on  the  Wyndham  Aboriginal  population  have  both  been  added  to  his-  tory,  it  might  be  worth-  while  to  give  a  quieter  account  than  the  spate  of  turbulent  official  bicker-  ing,  and  Ministerial  denial  that  accounted  for  the  majority  of  action  in-   volved.   Firstly  the  term  ""sub-  nutrition""  would  be  more  accurate  than  ""starvation"".  The  latter  word  has  con-  notations  of  Biafran  ribs,  whereas  the  actual  fact  is  that  most  of  these  kids  do  get  some  form  of  nutrition,  but  exist  on  a  diet  that  is  usually  so  insubstantial  that  they  are  usually,  but  not  always,  hungry.  A  common  diet  is  tea.  and  bread  and  a  succession  of  meals  can  run  to  tea  alone.   Some  Press  statements  quoted  local  reports  of  this  being  due  to  the  ""Abori-  ginal  mentality"",  a  wording  that  gives  inference  to  doubting  the  Aboriginal  intelligence.  The  disorgan-  isation  of  family  and  com-  munity  life  is  almost  a  permanent  feature  of  the  reserve  and  associate  dwellers,  and  such  people  had  little  chance  of  gaining  an  insight  into  the  organis-  ing  of  a  daily  routine  that  incorporates  budgeting  and  making  the  best  use  of  facilities  available.   So  instead  of  referring  to  the  people's  ""mentality""   as  a  cause,  it  would  be  nearer  the  truth  to  say  that  the  present  incident  is  the  usual,  and  that  it  stems  from  a  process  of  historical  factors  involving  white-  black  relationship  and  the  destruction  of  a  black  culture  and  organisation  by  the  white  population.  This  destruction  has  caused  a  void  to  appear,  and  the  Aborigines  live  within  it.  They  have  now  no  system  of  their  own,  and  they  have  not  been  given  the  chance  to  learn  the  white  system  that  has  been  im-  posed  upon  them.  They  are  continually  up  against  the  attitude  that  ""something  should  be  done  about  the  blackfellow""  while  very  few  actually  make  the  at-  tempt  to  do  anything  for   them.   The  effects  of  sub-  nutrition  are  plentiful  and  fairly  permanent.  Both  the  State  and  convent  school  have  incidents  of  Aborigi-  nal  children  just  not  coping  with  the  day's  school  work,  and  teachers  have  stated  that  a  fidgety  child  in  class  could  very  well  mean  a  hungry  child.  Conse-  quently  a  practice  has  developed  whereby  canned  milk  and  some  meals  are  given  to  these  children  at  the  commencement  of  the  day.  It  has  had  a  signifi-   cant  effect.   But  of  more  significance  is  the  permanent  effect  that  sub-nutrition  has  upon  the  overall  physical  and  mental  development  of  a  child.  He  or  she  is  not  going  to  die  through  lack  of  food,  but  at  the  same  time  due  to  the  in-  sufficiency  of  it,  he  or  she  is  just  not  going  to  ""make  it""  in  the  context  of  white  ideals.   This  letter  cannot  even  pretend  to  scratch  at  the  problem,  or  to  present  its  complexities,  but  when  Western  Australia's  Minis-  ter  for  Native  Welfare,  Mr  Lewis,  claims  that  there  is  ""no  evidence""'  that  Aborigines  were  after  food,  he  could  be  correct.  There  is  a  high  probability  that  the  children  were  looking  in  the  bins  for  soft  drink  bottles  so  as  to  trade  them  in  for  money.   But  when  Mr  Lewis  con-  tinues  on  to  say  that  there  was  ""no  reason""  to  believe  that  the  children  were  hungry,  he  may  have  been  able  to  select  just  that  moment  when  the  ones  concerned  were  not.  How  ever  this  does  not  account  for  the  previous  day  when  they  were  hungry,  and  the  days  to  come  when  they  will  be  hungry  again.   Native  Welfare  Depart-  ment  policy  states  that  it  prefers  Aborigines  to  have  responsibility.  But  at  the  same  time  Native  Welfare  neglects  the  fact  that  these  people  require  an  incred-  ible  amount  of  specific  help  in  all  fields  to  gain  even  the  confidence  re-   quired  to  attain  responsi  bility  for  themselves,  their  family  and  their  own  society,  be  it  the  white  or  the  black.   The  fact  to  remember  in  relation  to  the  Wynd-  ham  incident  is  that  this  is  no  rarity,  it  is  a  per-  sistent  occurrence  and  is  related  to  numerous  areas  throughout  Australia,  now.

"Aboriginal  assimilation   Sir,  -  The  time  has  come  when  the  Government  of  Austra  lia  must  make  drastic  changes  to  some  of  Australia's  laws  which  relate  to  the  assimilation  of  the  Australian  Aboriginal.   I  am  an  Aboriginal  and  I  do  not  want  to  be  assimilated  into  one  white-Australian  society  be  cause  it  is  impossible  for  me  to  change  the  colour  of  my  skin.   Because  I  am  well  dressed  and  clean  shaven  and  carry  a  brief  case,  many  white  people  say  to  me  ""what  part  of  America  do  you  come  from?""  and  ""how  do  you  like  this  country?""  That  to  me  just  goes  to  show  the  racist  apathy  other  black  visitors  face  when  they  are  in  Australia,  But  when  I  say,  ""I  like  this  country,  because  my  ancestors  owned  it,  and  they  were  robbed"",  this  is  then  followed  by  ""Oh!""   It  seems  to  me  that  while  Australians  are  not  willing  to  accept  that  Aborigines  can  make  it  and  be  on  par  with  the  so  called  articulate  white.  Not  only  that,  they  do  not  think  that  we  have  curly  hair  and  when  grown  long  it  looks  like  the  Afro  American  style.   Another  apathetic  and  racist  statement  which  again  is  used  by  many  whites  is  ""one  of  my  best  friends  is  black  /  or  Aboriginal"".  This  statement,  to  many  white  Australians,  is  used  to  justify  them  in  not  being  a  racist.  But  then  often  you  will  find  that  a  person  making  this  statement  is  then  often  you  will  find  that  a  person  making  this  statement  is  the  most  racist  of  them  all.   Because  these  are  the  general  attitudes  of  white  Australians  how  can  the  white  members  of  Parliament  say  and  be  otherwise,  after  all,  the  voters  are  white  and  it  is  compulsory  for  whites  to  vote  but  it  is  not  for  Abori  gines.  Not  only  that,  we  Abori  gines  only  make  up  1%  of  the  total  Australian  population  so  there  is  no  great  danger  of  us  blacks  putting  in  the  government   we  want.   If  I  were  a  white  Parlia  mentarian,  I  would  give  the  Aborigines  all  the  houses  they  wanted  in  the  white  communities  and  would  give  them  free  school  ing  and  would  indoctrinate  them  into  the  capitalistic  system  and  in  five  to  10  generatons  time  we  would  have  nobody  talking  about  land  rights  and  compensation,  in  stead  we  would  have  a  choco  late-coloured  Australian  society.   I  thought  Hitler  was  bad  and  many  people  say  how  barbaric  he  was  but  at  least  he  made  it  clear  and  had  the  guts  to  say  that  he  wanted  a  pure-white   world.   Australia,  however,  is  just  about  on  equal  par  with  Hitler  in  the  subtlety  in  assimilating  the  black  Australians  into  one  Australian  society  which  even  tually  will  be  all  white  with  the  exception  of  a  few  throw-backs.   To  see  racial  genocide  at  its  best  read  the  Australian  laws  on  assimilation  of  Aborgines,  it  puts  Hitler  to  shame.

"Aboriginal   rights   Sir,  —  There  are  many  good  rea  sons  why  Aboriginal  Australians  are  once  again  demonstrating  in  Can  berra,  this  time  in  tents  ont  Capital  Hill.  One  good  reason  is  because  the  proportion  of  the  Federal  Budget  spent  on  Aboriginal  recovery  has:  fallen  steadily  since  1974/75,  when  it  reached  a  record  0.9  per  cent.  Last  year,  1978/79,  it  was  only  0.57  per   cent.   This  means  that  in  four  yeau-s  the  proportion  has  fallen  by  one-third,,  which  shows  that  Australians  have  allowed  their  Government  to  care  very  much  less  about  Aboriginal  recovery.  Aboriginal  expectations  have  been  bitterly  disappointed.

"[?]   ""Group  solidarity  is  necessary  before  a  group  can  operate  from  a  bargaining  pos  ition  of  strength  in  a  pluralist  society.""  (Carmichael  and  Hamilton  'Black  Power').  ""Our  basic  demand  is  for  proportionate  participation  in  the  real  power  that  runs  this  country  -  decision  making  power  concerning  all  legislation,  all  appropriations,   every  area  of  life.""  (Eldridge  Cleaver  spokesman,  1969  Black  Panther).  The  most  striking  catch-cry  to  appear  in  the  vocabulary  of  race  relations  is  'Black  Power'.  These  two  words  cannote  the  ideology  of  the  activists  in  the  Negro  movement  in  America  at  the  present  time.  Increasingly  the  question  is  being  asked  in  Australia,  is  Black  Power  amongst  Abor-  iginal  groups  a  possibility  in  Aboriginal  Australia  and  if  it  is,  what  forms  will  it  take  and  will  it  lead  to  violent  protest  by  Aboriginals?  In  short,  throughout  the  Aboriginal  movement  in  Australia  people  are  asking  whether  Black  Power  is  the  coming  ideology  in  our  race  relations.  First  of  all  it  must  be  stressed  that  Australia  is  a  multi-racial  society  now,  whether  it  chooses  to  acknowledge  the  fact  or  not.  Clearly  the  Australian  Establishment  does  not.  Thus  we  find  protection  of.the  alleged  ""ethnic  homogeneity""  the  Australian  social  structure  set  forth  as  the  rationale,  for  the  continuing'  of  our  immigration  policy.  The  Aboriginal  population  of  the  two  Sydney  suburbe  of  Paddington  and  Redfern  is  now  estimated  at  over  15,000  Lancaster  Jones  in  his  still  current  demo-  graphic  survey  of  the  Aboriginal  population  of  the  Northern  Territory  is  able  to  show  that  in  twenty  five  years  time  large  areas  of  northern  Australia  -  including  parts  pf  Western  Australia,  Queensland  and  the  Territory  -  will  have  25%  or  more  of  their  population  made  up  of  Aborigin-  als  and  Islanders  due  to  the-high  birth  rate  amongst  Aboriginals.  In  his  lecture  'Towards  a  Multi-Racial  Society',  Dr  Barrie  Pittock  is  able  to  take  this  demographic  analysis  one  step  further  when  he  rightly  points  out  that  this  expanding  ethnic  minority  will  be  existing  in  what  the  sociologists  refer  to  as  a  classic  culture  of  poverty  situation.  He  quotes  the  American  sociologist  Oscar  Lewis  on  this  point.  ""People  in  a  culture  of  poverty  pro-  duce  little  wealth-  and  receive  little  in  return.  Chronic  unemployment  and  underemployment,  low  wages,  lack  of  property,  lack  of  savings,  absence  of  food  reserves  in  the  home  and  chronic  shortage  of  cash,  imprison  the  family  and  the  community  in  a  vicious  circle.  Along  with  the  disengagement  from  the  larger  society  there  is  a  hostility  to  the  '  basic  institutions  of  what  are  regarded  as  the  dominant  classes.  There  is  hatred  of  the  police,  mistrust  of  government  and  of  those  in  high  positions  and  a  cynicism  that  extends  to  the  church.  This  gives  the  culture  of  poverty  a  high  potential  for  protest  and  for  being  used  in  political  movements  aimed  against  the  existing  sociel  order,""  This  is  precisely  what  Pittock  sees  in  inner  suburban  ghettoes  in  southern  Australia  and  in  expanding  shanty  towns  on  the  outskirts  of  European  settlements  throughout  the  North.   In  these  two  situations  lie  the  seeds  of  Black  Power  violence  in  Australia,  so  Pittock  argues.  One  can  only  agree  with  him  that  this  seems  highly  likely.  However,  when  we  look  for  evidence  '  of  Aboriginal  group  solidarity,  it  must  be  admitted  that  so  far  there  has  been  very  little  manifestation  of  this.  As  Professor  Stanner  has  pointed  out  in  his  Boyer  lectures  last  year  entitled  'After  the  Dreaming',  the  Aboriginal  movement  until  the  last  decade  has  been  European  dominated  in  terms  of  organ-  isation  and  ideas.  The  so-called  advance-  ment  organisations  have  indirectly  foisted  their  own  form  of  paternalism  on  their  Aboriginal  members.  Aboriginals  were  sometimes  used  as  spokesmen  but  the  real  decisions,  even  in  these  supposedly  liberal  organisations,  were  taken  by  Europeans.  And  above  and  beyond  this  stands  the  crucial  factor  of  legislative  'pro-  tection'  of  Aboriginals  in  the  areas  where  the  large  concentrations  exist  —  an  in-  credible  network  of  interlocking  acts  and  regulations  that  place  Aboriginals  under  the  arbitary  control  of  European  reserve  administrators  in  a  total  sense.  If  one  looks  closely  at  the  Queensland  Aboriginal  and  Islander  Affairs  Act  of  1965  which  re-enacts  with  precious  little  changes  the  whole  sweep  of  legis-  lative  restrictions  that  apply  under  that  Act  to  'assisted  Aboriginals',  the  special  category  of  Aboriginals  that  are  regi-  mented  down  to  the  tiniest  details  of  their  lives  by  these  provisions,  com-  parison  with  the  racial  legislation  of  South  Africa  is  inevitable.  It  is  incredible  that  in  1969  an  'assisted  Aboriginal  on  Bamaga  reserve  -  I  or  on  any  reserve  -  can  be  liable  for  up  to  |  six  months  imprisonment  for  swearing  at  a  European  reserve  overseer.  The  damage  that  this  combination  of  a  reserve  system  with  vicious  repressive  legislation  and  domination  by  a  European  administrative  class  has  done  to  the  devel-  opment  of  a  sense  of  Aboriginal  com-  munity  in  northern  Australia  has  yet  to  be  demonstrated  yet  its  effect  has  clearly  been  profound.  Another  factor  arising  from  the  total  failure  of  our  education  system  to  cope  with  the  needs  of  Aboriginals,  is  the  almost  complete  absence  till  the  last  :  few  years  of  educated  experienced  and  articulate  black  leadership  in  the  Aboriginal  movement.  The  Aboriginal  movement  has  yet  to  throw  up  a  leader  with  intellectual  training  of  a  Stokely  Carmichael  or  Professor  Hamilton.  Indeed  the  idea  of  an  Abor-  iginal  holding  a  university  chair  in  the  present  Aboriginal  education  context  is  very  definitely  a  thing  of  the  future.  There,  then,  are  the  factors  limiting  the  development  of  Aboriginal  politics  -  economic  group  solidarity.  We  have  seen  isolated  attempts  to  use  the  ballot  box  to  achieve  political  representation  for  the  Aboriginal  interest.  Two  candidates  stood  in  the  Northern  Territory  Council  elections  earlier  this  year  as  Independents.  Last  month,  Mrs.  Kath  Walker/Aboriginal  poet  and  spoke-  swoman,  stood  as  Labor  candidate  for  the  Brisbane  metropolitan  seat  of  Green-  slopes  in  the  Queensland  State  elections  and  polled  very  creditably.   ABORIGINAL  POWER   This  use  of  the  electoral  system  has  as  yet  been  a  series  of  ad  hoc  initiatives,  sponsored  by  .European  bankers  and  advisors.  The  Northern  Territory  sit-  uation,  however,  looks  extremely  pro-  jmising  and  there  are  very  real  grounds  for  hope  that  there  will  be  at  least  two  Abor-  iginal  members  of  the  Council  after  the  next  elections.  Far  more  significant  are  the  demands  being  made  by  Aboriginal  communities  for  Government  agencies  and  volutary  agen-  cies  to  include  Aboriginals  -  and  increas-  ingly  the  demand  is  for  at  least  a  clear  majority  of  Aboriginals  -  to  be  making  executive  decisions  within  these  structures.  Even  consultation  with  Aboriginal  opinion  is  not  seen  as  satisfactory  any  more.  The  real  decision  making  power  must  be  given  to  Aboriginals  and  not  left  with  Europeans  to  do  'what  they  think  best'  for  the  Aboriginals  they  are  supposed  to  be  working  for.  When  Government  agencies,  such  as  the  Commonwealth  Office  of  Aboriginal  Affairs  have  organised  consultative  meetings  of  Aboriginals  in  the  last  fifteen  months  they  have  increasingly  been  faced  with  this  demand  for  Aboriginal  self-determination.  More  importantly  volutary  organisations  now  have  to  cope  with  Aboriginals  demanding  the  same  executive  power  in  these  non-government  bodies.  FCAATSI,  the  national  Aboriginal  .Congress  last  Easter  saw  a  floor  revolt  of  Aboriginals,  demanding  more  say  in  the  decision  making  of  the  congress  with  its  predominantly  European  executive.  Un-  less  this  body  can  make  it  clear  that  it  is  an  organisation  open  to  the  ideas  and  aspirations  of  all  Aboriginal  groups  its  role  as  a  national  Aboriginal  forum  is  seriously  in  doubt.  In  each  State,  we  have  seen  the  pro-  liferation  of  all-Aboriginal  Tribal  Council,  demanding  to  speak  on  behalf  of  Abor-  iginals  in  their  state.  Despite  the  perennial  in-fighting  that  Aboriginal  Affairs  organ-  isation  involve  themselves  in,  the  principle  that  all-Aboriginal  organisations  should  speak  with  authority  is  being  accepted  more  and  more.  Charles-Perkins  has  claimed  that  unless  radical  Commonwealth  initiatives  and  massive  expenditure  is  commenced  by  the  Federal  Government,  there  will  be  Black  Power  violence  in  Aboriginal  communities.  On  Pittock's  analysis  this  is  likely  for  the  ingredients  of  violent  frustrated  reaction  that  have  brought  on  the  race  explosion  in  the  US  are  talent  in  the  Aboriginal  context.  Furthermore,  the  US  developments  have  shown  us  that  human  beings  will  only  accept  institutionalised  racism,  the  squalor  of  the  humpy,  for  so  long.  When  this  patience  is  exhausted,  the  glaring  organisational  weakness  of  the    Aboriginal  movement  probably  will  not  save  Australia  from  these  racial  traumas.  Certainly  we  will  see  greater  Aboriginal  militantism.

"Aboriginal   education   Sir,  -  Pat  Eatock  has  accused  me  of  lying  about  the  existence  of  statistics  on  Aboriginal  edu  cation  being  in  the  Neal  and  Radford  report.  She  says,  ""Hay  ing  carefully  read  the  Neal  and  Radford  report,  I  can  assure  the  public  that  such  statistics  are  not  available  from  the  report"".   If  she  reads  the  report  a  little  more  carefully,  she_  will  find,  on  page  94,  the  following  statement:   ""It  is  estimated  that  of  the  eligible  children  already  more  than  70%  are  attending  pre  schools,  90%  primary  schools  and  70%  post-primary  sections  of  primary  schools  or  other  secondary  schools"".   As  to  the  definition  of  the  word  ""eligible"",  Mrs  Eatock  suggests  that  this  may  be  some  sneaky  distortion.  Dr  Neal  is  a  little  difficult  to  contact  at  the  University  of  Alberta,  but  Dr  Radford  is  available  at  the  Aus  tralian  Council  for  Educational  Research  in  Hawthorn,  Victoria.   Mrs  Eatock  quotes  statistics  of  high  drop-out  rate  at  the  Abor  iginal  pre  -  primary  Kormilda  College  in  Darwin,  suggesting  that  this  is  some  fault  of  the  Government.  That  survey  was  completed  in  1970,  after  three  years  of  operation  of  the  col  lege.  When  I  visited  there  re  cently,  I  was  assured  that  the  drop-out  rate  was  now  much  lower.  But  even  if  it  were  not,  would  Mrs  Eatock  please  tell  us  why  she  thinks  it  happens,  and  exactly  what  the  Govern  ment  should  do  about  it?   Mrs  Eatock  asks  for  an  explan  ation  of  ""why  the  Government  ignores  the  illegal  non-attend  .ance  of  school-age  'Aboriginal  children  yet  enforces  school  '  attendance  of  white  children?""   Again,  what  type  of  enforcement  would  Mrs  Eatock  like  to  see  the  Government  introduce?   When  I  had  a  discussion  with  Aboriginal  (and  these  were  real  Aborigines)  trainee  teachers  at  Kormilda  College,  one  of  the  complaints  to  me  was  that  too  many  Aboriginal  children  were  being  ""forced""  to  attend  second  ary  schools,  against  their  will.   The  Government  gets  a  lot  of  conflicting  advice  about  what  should  best  be  done  to  assist  Aborigines.  In  education,  the  Government  has  followed  the  recommendations  of  the  Watts-Gallacher  Report   It  it  interesting  that  tha  coin   slant  critics  of  the  Government  do  not  give  any  credit  for  high  standards  achieved  under  very  difficult  circumstances.  The  70%  of  Aboriginal  children  being  provided  with  pre-school  education,  in  spite  of  the  vast  distances  and  scattered  popula  tion,  is  far  better  than  for  the  rest  of  Australia.

"Aboriginal  genocide   The  NSW  Premier  recently  stated  to  the  World  Congress  on  Law  that  the  law  had  become  ""a  means  of  bondage  and  cultural   oppression""  to  the  Australian  AboriginevS.  He  outlined  that  the  Aborigines  were  one  of  the  world's  most  deprived  and  depressed  minorities.  200  years  of  ruthless  oppression  sees  the  truth  of  this  statement.  In  April,  or  sometime  in  1928,  the  Workers'  Weekly  exposed  ill-  treatment  of  Aborigines  in  an  Alice  Springs  Police  Stockade.  At  about  the  same  time  I  exposed  the  shooting  of  a  whole  tribe  by  a  punitive  police  party  which  wiped  out  42  men,  women  and  children.  The  massacre  was  because  of  the  death  of  a  Constable  McColl  who  was  speared  by  an  Aborigine.  I  pointed  out  at  the  Inquiry  that  the  Aborigine  had  not  come  from  the  massacred  tribe.  The  Inquiry  found  my  allegations  proved,  but  the  killing  of  the  42  Aborigines  justified.

It  is  men  such  as  these  -  too  many  to  quote  here  -  who,  like  Ian  Smith  of  Rhodesia,  have  kept  blacks  in  inhuman  bondage.  But  I  trust  it  won't  be  long  before  real  freedom  and  emancipation  will  come  to  these  people  including  the  Australian  Aborigines.  The  writing  is  clearly  on  the  wall.

"Aboriginal  heritage   Jon  Rhodes  is  a  photographer,  born  1947  in  Wagga,  who  has  amongst  other  projects,  recently  made  educational  films  in  India.   (BY  RUTH  FAERBER)   His  exhibition  at  the  Australian  Centre  for   Photography  of  a  “snap   shot”  series,  shows  the  im-  pact  of  bauxite  mining  on  an  Aborigine  community  in  the  Cape  York  Peninsula  and  is,  in  fact,  also  an  education  to  busy  city   dwellers.   The  political  history  of  the  encroachment  of  mining  companies  since  1966,  into  the  land  and  the  life  style  of  the  Aborigines,  is  presented  in  the  catalogue  in  the  form  of  a  collection  of  documented  quotes  from  court  proceedings,  literature  and  actual  data,  illustrated  by  monotone  photographs  which,  by  their  natural   spontaneous  images  and,  relaxed,  ordered  presen-  tation,  unfold  the  facts  with  conviction  based  on  reason.   Any  one  of  the  sensitively  composed  photos  could  exist  individually  as  genre  or  landscape  pictures;  col-  lectively  they  represent  an  insistent  documentation  of  a  community’s  resistance  to  corporation  power,  their  ‘homeland  movement’  at-  tempting  a  return  to  trad-  itional  crafts  and  life  style,  and  their  inevitable  sign  of  partially  succumbing  to  prevailing  alien  influences.   In  the  upstairs  gallery  a  particularly  choice  mixed  international  exhibition  of  enlarged  colour  photographs  (originally  produced  on  the  Polaroid   camera)  includes  such  im-  portant  names  as  Charles  Eames,  Ikko,  Sam  Haskins  etc.,  also  the  Melbourne  photographer  Robert  Ashton.   *  *  *  *  .   Prints  of  another   medium  and  vintage  celebrate  the  2nd  an-  niversary  of  Stadia  Graphics  Gallery  and  tran-  sform  it  into  an  array  of  large  scale  colourful  posters.   Titled  “La  Belle  Epoque”  they  cover  the  period  1880-1914  during  France’s  exhilarating  wave  of  industrial  ex-  pansion  and  prosperity;  and  the  theatre,  newly  developed  means  of  tran-   sport  and  newly  manufac-  tured  products  found  their  representation  in  these  hand  printed  lithographic  commercial  posters.   Shades  of  decorative  art  noveau  swirls  and  curls,  mix  with  the  more  oriental  print  influence  of  flat  strong  colour.   Toulouse-Lautrec,  Muc-  ha,  Steinlen,  Cheret  feature  amongst  the  18  artists  in-  cluded  in  what  is  certainly  a  tour-de-force  of  style,  scale  and  the  spice  of  life.   The  Sydney  Print-  makers’  annual  exhibition  at  the  Macquarie  Galleries  offers  a  more  sober  (and  contemporary)  collection  of  prints,  but  no  less  in-  teresting.

She  projects  a  sweeping  spacial  flow  in  the  transparent  and  intermingling  glazes,  as  they  separate  and  resettle  into  delicate  pools  and  tracery  of  rich  colour.  Unity  of  form  asserts  itself  as  she  contains  this  active  surface  against  a  foil  of  uninflected  stable  hue.  The  intimate  nature  of  these  works  draws  the  viewer  in  revealing  also  her  representation  of  man  as  a  small  help-   less  being  caught  in  the  forces  of  destiny.",263291570,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/263291570,Aboriginal heritage,Article,1976-09-09,22,22,"Jon Rhodes is a photographer, born 1947 in Wagga, who has amongst other projects, recently made educational films in India.

The  four  were  Mike  Anderson  (spokes  man  for  the  group),  Billie  Craigie,  Bert  Williams  and  Tony  Correy,  who  travelled  from  Sydney  to  initiate  the  vigil,  which  they  say  will  continue  until  mid-February  when  Parliament  resumes.  Mike  Anderson  said  that  by  that  time  there  should  be  about  two  hundred  Ko-  ories  (Aborigines)  from  all  parts  of  Aus  tralia  camped  on  Parliament's  front  lawn.  The  demand  is  for  the  recognition  of  the  rights  of  Koories  to  existing  Abori  ginal  lands  and  compensation  for  those  already  lost.

"Aboriginal  question   Sir,  —  Sylvia  Whyte  (Letlers,  September  7),  while  claiming  to  have  had  some  sympathy  for  Aboriginal  Australians  shows  a  lack  of  any  understanding  of  the  injustices  faced  by  Aborigines.   She  suggests  that  only  the  great-grandfathers  of  _  today's  Aborigines  suffered  injustice.  However  the  injustice  only  start  ed  with  the  great-grandfathers.   The  1960s  and  1970s  have  seen  the  continued  process  of  white  people  taking  land  front  Aborigines  (Bagot,  Gove,  Ma  poon)  and  there  is  growing  con  cern  that  the  Queensland  Government  has  its  greedy  eye  on  Palm  Island.   In  a  survey  of  Aboriginal  housing  in  NSW  (one  of  the  bet  ter  States)  C.  D.  Rowley  re  ported  that  37  per  cent  were'  classified  as  shacks,  51  per  cent  with  no  or  not  enough  beds,  49  per  cent  with  no  laundry,  46  per  cent  with  no  separate  kitchen,  38  per  cent  with  no  water  supply  and  41  per  cent  with  no  garbage  disposal.   The'  Australian  Press  in  recent  years  has  publicised  the  high  infant  mortality  rales  among  Aborigines,  sub-standard  nutrition  to  a  degree  leading  to  permanent  handicap  and  the  high  incidence  of  blindness.   About  one-third  of  persons  in  prison  in  Western  Australia  are  Aboriginal  (overwhelmingly  on  trivial  offences),  although  they  only  account  for  one  per  cent  of  that  State's  population.   When  it  comes  to  employment,  Aboriginals  can  only  find  low  paid  jobs  if  they  are  lucky  enough  to  score  a  job.   S.  Whyte  says  that  the  Abori  gines  on  the  Frost  show  were  ill  mannered,  foul-mouthed  hooli  gans.  Rather  they  were  angry   and  frustrated.

"On  Monday  6th  August,  a  national  Aboriginal  Government  was  established  after  a  unanimous  motion  from  the  National  Aboriginal  Conference.  The  first  tents  were  set  p  at  4am  on  Tuesday  7th  August  and  now  the  National  Aboriginal  Government  is  ituated  on  Capital  Hill,  the  site  of  the  new  Parliament  House,  manned  by  members  of  the  aradjarai,  Gomilaroi  and  Bandjalang  people.   It  is  interesting  to  ponder  over  the  point  of  news  coverage  the  media  has  given  the  National  Aboriginal  Government.,  One  only  has  to  look  at  the  coverage  given  to  the  Taree  incident  of  2  weeks  ago~and  compare  that  amount  to  .coverage  of  the  NAG  ;n  Canberra.  It  is  in  this  that  the  media's  bias  is  evident,  and  obvious  that  unless  the  aboriginal  cause  is  connected  with  violence,  drunkenness  or  other  issues  that  can  be  sensationalised,  it  doesn't  rate  a  mention.  The  NAG's  basic  aims  are  land  rights,  to  establish  Unity  in  the  Aboriginal  Nation^  and  to  demand  a  treaty  of  Committment  with  Australia  and  its  governing  body  and  to  legislate  an  amendment  to  the  federal  constitution  with  a  federal  Aboriginal  Bill  of  Rights.  The  NAG  also  wants  an  autonomous  body  of  Aboriginals  democratically  elected  by  the  aboriginal  nation  with  staturoy  powers  to  govern  all  aspects  related  to  the  affairs  of  the  Aboriginal  nation.  A  spokesman  for  the  NAG  Mr  Bill  Craigîe,  outlined  several  main  points  the  NAG  wanted  included  in  the  Federal  Bill  of  Aboriginal  Rights.  Amongst  other  things  the  aborigines  want  a  guarantee  that  all  traditional  lands  and  sacred  sites,  where  they  can  be  proven  as  such,  be  handed  over  to  the  traditional  owners  as  freehold  ownership.  All  grounds  where  massacres  occured  be  presentedd  to  the  aboriginal  people  as  memorials,  and  all  misssion  stations  and  reserves  now  inhabited  by  aboriginals  under  state  law,  be  handed  o\fer  to  the  inhabitants  of  such  reserves.  Mr  Craigie  also  said  that  compensation  should  be  paid  to  those  aboriginals  alienated  from  their  traditional  land  and  those  aborigines  whose  culture,  religion,  language  and  ability  to  pass  on  their  laws  had  been  inhibited  or  interfered  with.  The  final  demand  the  bill  of  rights  makes  is  that  a  fixed  percentage  of  National  Gross  product  be  handed  over  to  an  elected  aboriginal  body  for  the  welfare  and  lifestyles  of  aboriginal  people  to  be  maintained  in  the  future.  The  National  Aboriginal  Government  intends  to  maintain  its  stand  until  Australia  and  its  government  respects   and  negotiates  the  demands  of  the  Aboriginal  nation.  One  could  ask  why  the  Aborigines  have  now  suddenly  decided  to  set  up  a  National  Aboriginal  Government.  In  talking  to  Aborigines  I  have  detected  a  big  feeling  of  frustration  with  the  way  they  are  being  'handled'  by  the  Federal  government.  'Handled'  sounds  as  if  they  are  just  like  animals,  but  unfortunately  the  facts  tend  to  indicate  that  many  animals  have  it  better  than  the  aboriginal  people,  especially  when  it  comes  to  health  care.  A  recent  sutdy  done  by  the  Royal  Australian  College  of  Opthalmologists  facutally  established  the  continuing  neglect  of  aborigines.  It  stated  that  ""aboriginals  were  outside  any  effective  Australian  health  system"".  Overall,  two  in  every  five  aboriginals  has  trachoma,  a  disease  which  if  not  treated  leads  to  blindness.  As  many  as  one  in  every  25  aborigines  examined  had  evidence  of  skin  dieease  and  there  are  some  15,000  aborigines  with  leprosy,  and  the  disease  is  not  under  control.  On  top  of  this  one  finds  the  average  life  span  of  a  male  aboriginal  in  NSW  is  estimated  at  38.  Aborigines  suffer  the  highest  rate  of  convictions  in  the  courts,  whilst  they  total  only  1%  of  total  Australian  population.  The  proportion  of  Aborigines  in  prison  is  30%  of  the  ""population  \yhile  90%  of  Aborigines  are  unemployed,  and  o'ver  50%  are  still  not  housed.  Statistics  like  this  are  repeated  like  clockwork  to  an  extent  where  the  media  becomes  disinterested,  and  racism  once  again  come  to  the  forefront.  One  now  begins  to  understand  the  motivation  behind  the  NAG  at  Capital  Hill,  but  there  is  more.  The  government  has  just  increased  spending  in  Aboriginal  affairs  by  9%  to  $125  million.  However,  upon  investigation,  it  is  discovered  this  increase  is  to  fund  the  Aboriginal  Development  Agency  (ADA)  which  will  co-opt  all  financial  distribution  from  the  present  Department  of  Aboriginal  Affairs.  The  only  body  representing  the  Aboriginal  nation  is  the  National  Aboriginal  Conference,   supposedly  democratically  elected,  but  the  Minister  has  power  of  veto.  The  result  is:  a  number  of  factions  develop,  more  jobs  are  created  for  non-aboriginals  and  the  money  is  spent  on  commissions  and  the  bureaucracy  instead  of  the  aborigines.  Up  until  this  article  was  written  (5th  September)  Frazer  and  Chaney  had  done  nothing  except  send  messages  via  chauffers   in  white  limousines  to  the  NAG.  They  had  sent  back  replies  that  if  Fraser  and  Chaney  wanted  to  speak  to  the  NAG,  they  were  welcome  to  come  to  Capital  Hill.  Whatever  the  results,  the  National  Aboriginal  Government  is  determined,  to  have  the  voice  of  the  Australian  aborigines  heard.

"Aboriginal   land   claims   Sir,  -  I  am  forced  to  reply  to  your  unnamed  special  correspondent  of  July  2,  1978,  page  6,  under  the  heading  'Massive  land  claims'.   In  the  first  place,  he  has  misled  your  readers  when  he  says  ""Aboriginal  lands,  the  magnitude  of  which  has  only  been  outlined  in   recent  months"".   Of  course  this  is  not  true.  For  many  years  before  the  advent  of  the  Woodward  Commission,  certainly  the  black  population  knew  of  its  size  and  even  the  white  pastoralists  who  then  numbered  less  than  the  Aboriginal  population  knew  of  the  lands  they  held  because  many  of  their  ancestors  murdered  many  Aboriginal  tribes  to  steal  the  land  in  the  first  place.   Your  correspondent  fails  to  point  out  that  most  of  the  whites,  which  includes  the  majority  of  those  who  have  represented  them  at  the  local  Legislative  Assembly  and  before  that  the  Council,  were  not  born  in  the  Northern  Territory.  Equally,  the  majority  of  white  voters  were  not   born  there.   Your  correspondent  also  tries  to  mislead  your  readers  by  implying  that  the  Northern  Lands  Council  is  guilty  of  a  major  conspiracy  when  they  are  presented  with  ""the  NLC  had  plans  made  to  step  in  during  that   period  -  it  might  have  been  only  a  few  hours  or  so  -  and  lay  claim  to  the  property""  the  politician  said  ""fortunately  somebody  tipped  off  the  owners  and  they  are  making  other  arrangements"".   Of  course  both  the  Woodward  Commission  and  the  Fox  Com  mission  have  extensive  evidence  to  the  extent  of  the  land  claims  that  are  to  be  claimed.   Both  your  correspondent  and  those  whites  whom  he  obviously  re  presents  are  like  the  Nazis.  The  full  story  of  the  rape  of  the  Aboriginal  people  of  the  northern  tribes  has  not  yet  come  out,  but  what  has  emerged  to  date  is  evidence  enough  to  ensure  our  right  to  claim  what  has  been  ours  for  over  40,000  years  which  both  your  correspondent,  and  the  whites  whom  he  represents,  refuse  to  recog   nise.   As  an  Aboriginal  person,  born  on  a  reserve  in  the  Northern  Territory,  a  person  who  has  been  interested  enough  in  the  processes  of  the  law  to  make  submissions  to  both  the  Woodward  Commission  and  the  Fox  Commission,  unlike  your  correspon  dent  and  the  whites  he  represents  -  as  such  I  am  disgusted  that  you  have  stooped  to  print  such  trash.
