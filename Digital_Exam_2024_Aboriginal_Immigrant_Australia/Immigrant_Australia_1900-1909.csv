"Immigrant  Girls.   The  arrival  of  the  immigrant  girls  by  the  Surrey  directs  attention  to  the  whole  question  of  how  our  population  may  most  easily  be  increased.  The  best  of  all  ways  is  probably  the  gradual  growth  of  generation  after  generation,  But  it  is  usually  a  slow  way.  European  popula-,  tiona  on  an  average  double  themselves  in  a  hundred  years.  England  performs  the  same  feat  in  sixty  years  or  so.  The  Russian  Jew  is  credited  with  being  so  prolific  as  to  double  in  numbers  every  fourteen  years,  but  that  is  probably  an  exaggeration.  Yet  if  Western  Australia  were  to  wait  fifty  years  for  her  popula-  tion  to  reach  360,000  it  would  be  discour-  aging  to  those-and  they  are  the  major-  ity  in  any  country-who  wish  to  see  the  greatest  possible  improvement  in  their  own  day.  We  might,  of  course,-have  en  other  rush  from  eastern  Australia,  but  no  part,  of  the  Commonwealth'  can  spare  population.  As  experience  shows,  wo  can  do  a  little  towards  assisting  emi-  grants  from  England.  But  it  is  little,  and  while  England  enjoys  such  good  times  as  at  present  it  is  not  likely  to  greatly  in-  crease.  As  for  the  immigrants  who  can  pay  their  way,  we  already  offer  free  land  ana  ¿ll  sorts  of  facilities.  These  are  not  suf-  ficient  to  deflect  the  scream  that  goes  westward  across  the  Atlantic,  Every  col-  ony  is  faced  with  the  same  difficulty.  Each  has  triecÇseveral  methods.  Queens-  land  did  much  in  the  way  of  assisted  pas-  sages.  Worked  with  proper  safeguards  it  is  successful,  but  is  too  costly  for  indefi-  nite  expansion.  In  ten  years  the  total  increase  in  the  population  of  Australia  by  excess  of  arrivals  over  departures  has  not  been  greatly  above  100,000.  This  is  less  than  the  natural  increase  by  the  ex-  cess  of  births  over  deaths  in  two  normal  years.  There  is  a  tendency  in  many  ?quarters  to  regard  any  great  influx  from  old  lands  with  suspicion,  on  the  ground  that  it  reduces  wages.'  Even  if  it  tempor-  arily  reduces  wages-which  is  far  from  proved-this  is  a  shortsighted  view'  to  take.  Every  additional  honest  indust-  rious  man  in  the  community  is  a  distinct  gain,  and  the  same  is  the  case  with  wo-  men  and  children.  There  has  been  ob-  jection  to  the  immigrant  girls  on  this  bas-  is.  In  any  case  there  are  not  enough  of  them  to  make,  any  considerable  difference  one  way  or  another.  It  is  a  half-hearted  way  of  dealing  with  the  problem.  If  Aus-  tralia  decides  not  to  try  assisted  passages  from  England,  it  might  attempt  to  wide-  ly  advertise  on  the  continent  of  Europe,  and  so  get  some  of  the  alien  wave  that  floods  into  the  United  States.  But  if  the  labour  party  regards  some  classes  of  Eng-  lish  immigrants  with  some  suspicion,  a  far  larger  section  of  the  .  community  would  opposé  any  considerable  irruption  of  Italians,  Spaniard«,  Austrians,  or  even  Germans  and  Scandinavians.  Yet  out  of  these  races  the  United  States  is  making  A  strong  English  speaking  community.  If  Australia  is  fed  by  only  a  slight  stream  of  immigration  it  will  apparently  show  the  world  a  country  in  which  there  is  a  very  high  average  standard  of  living)  and  a  verv  sparse  population.  This  will  make  us  perpetually  subject  to  the  revivar  of  that  old  bugbear-an  Asiatic  invasion  of  the  tropical  north.  If  we  had-a  con-  siderable  population  that  scare  would  be  laid  for  eyer.  But  at  present  the  Com-  monwealth  consists  of  some  four  million  of  people  who  have  hold  of  a  very  large  estate  which  it  may  take  them  all  their  time  and  skill  and  bravery  to  retain.",33199598,https://api.trove.nla.gov.au/v3/newspaper/33199598,Immigrant Girls.,Article,1901-02-02,27,27,The arrival of the immigrant girls by the Surrey directs attention to the whole question of how our population may most easily be increased.

"X  Immigrant  Labourers.   T  The  arrival  ol  a  batch  o!  working  men  ""v  from  southward  in  Queensland,  in.search  ]•':  of  work,  has  raised  two  or  three  ques   tions,  beside  that  of  finding  work  lor  |  .these  men.  It  seems  that  they  came  on  -  their  own  account,'  that  no  one  -■  sent  them,  or  sent  .  for  them.   Then,  why  did  they  leave'  their  former  place  of  residence?  We  must  V  assume  that  they  found  themselves  in  a   wilderness,  and  that  they  matched  to  -  Queensland  as  a  land  of  promise.  IVhat   Is  the  matter  with  industries  down  south?  Is  there  no  ■  employment  -  in  Victoria,  or  ""  in  New  South  Wales  ?  Federal  and  State  '  money,  in  millions  ,  is  being  spent  down   that  way.  Even  il  most  ol  it  is  being  spent  in  official  life,  there  should  be  in  dustrial  employment,  for  someone  mnst  grow  or  produce  the  food  for  .  this  great  official  army,  all  ot  whose  members'  also  must  be  well  clothed.  Occasionally  some  :■  of  the  Ministers  arc  arrayed,lite  Solo   mon  in  all  his'glory.  Perhaps  nil  ot  the  land  in  victoria  has  been  taken  up  by  '  persons  Who  can  do  their  own  work   thereon.  As  to  trades,  in  Melbourne  1  '  itsrli,  they  must  be  suffering  not  a  little  '  in  spite  ot  protection.  Melbourne  is.  he   romiag  tlie  i^feat  port  for  oversea  trade.   In  the  circumstances  it  is  very  likely-,  that  local  industries  arc  somewhat  dis  .  couraged,""  so  that'a  good  many  workers  .-  must  go  elsewhere  for  employment.  Diir   :  ing  the  past  few  -  months  so  much  has  """"  been,  said  about  the  resources  and  pros  '""^iects  '  of  Queensland,  that  individuals  '  ""  at  a  distance,  have  been  captivated.  So   far  back  in  time  as  Fcbruarv  in  last  year,  our  Premier  in  office  closed  his  political  ^  manifesto  in  the  words-of  agrcat  orator,   toy  assuring  his  Hearers  and  readers  that  :  under  his  administration  ol  public  affairs  ■  HVis'conntry  would  enter  on  a  period  oi  '  'prosperity  the  like  ot  which  never  before   Itad  been  witnessed  in  our  history.  From  ■  .thai  time  to  this,  as  occasion  offered.  Mr.  >,  5viitstonbas  told  mankind  in  general,  and   'Australia  in  particular,  that  Queensland  is  in  sooth  too  promised  land.  Therefore  we  should  not  be  surprised  if  at  least  a  few  ""  persons  'have  suffered  an  elevation  of   ""their  hopes  and  expectations,  to  be  wo  ?%juli;v  disappointed  on  their  coming  to  this   ^'rerthrr,  it  may  he  inquired  as  to  how  '  these  wild  and  exaggerated  statements  fit  ""  jn  with  what  seriously  is  taken  to   a  he  toe  immigration  policy  oi  the  present]   Government.  In  his  Kockbampton  nmm  lasto  Mr.  Kidston  promised  what'ee  called  a  ""bold  Immigration  policy.  What  jr.  the  meaning  ot  the  term  ""bold  in  that  ;  expression?  As  it  may  serve  the  pur   poses  of  two  very  different  classes  01  in  dividuals,  a  bold  immigration  may  signify  the  introduction  of  wage  earners,  or  _it  mav  signlty  the  introduction  of  men  with   some  capital  to  settle  on  thc  land.  ^  No   ___  0»  opeiuuoulhed  indlvidu  :  ;  crvidE'  the  immigration   ol  millions  oi  persons  into  this  country  hns  ever  suggested  whence  must  come  She  capital  for.  .their  employment.  4£.ien  reduced  to  a  practical  form,  the  emelovee  implies  the  employer.

And.  by  tbe  wsy  why  should  the  department  exert  itscll  to  find  employment  for  there  strangers,  mean  while  to  house  and  to  feed  them,  when  unemployed  men  previously  jnourmifct  have  to  house  and  tb™  selves  if  they  can,  or.  to  do  the  other  -  .thing  T  This  brings  us  to  another  question.   •If  this  ""bold""  immigration  policy  is  to  favour  toe  incoming  of  men  with  a  smau  1  amount  oi  capital,  the  question  is,  how  J   are  we  to  get  hold  ot  men  of  that  class  1  If  they  are  In  southern  ^States,,  why.  do  they  not  come  here  ?  Because  they  are  well  enough  off  where  they  are.  If  they   in  European  countries,  why  do  they  hot  come  here?  Because  they  fear   that  they  could  not  better  themselves.  The  business  of  seltine  up  a  ""bold""  im  migration  policy  appears1  to  be  merely  hustings  talk.  Politicians  of  one  party  ob  ject  to  bringing  in  the  mere  wage  earner.

The  situation  was  not  improved  by  the  mosquitoes  taking  such  a  violent  fancy  to  my  face  that  people  'looked  askance  at  me  wherever  I  went,  for,  at  that  time,  the  smallpox  jwas  prevalent  in  Sydney,  and  my  appearance  in  the  streets  was-  evidently  ^regarded  as  a.  serious,  reflec  tion  on  the  vigilance  of  the  Health  authori  ties.  I  had  a  rough  time,  but  pulled  through  somehow—  there  was  water  in  the  fountains  and  the  'nights  were  warm.  An  advt.  in  the  'Herald'  caught  my  eye  one  ]  morning  very  early  —  I  used  to  read  them  by  matchlight  —  and  fascinated  me  with  visions  of  a  trip  to  New  Zealand.  .  It  was  for  a  steward  .on  the  Union  Co.'s  s.s.

L.W  hew  !  As.  ,1  .  have  said,  the  -.ship  had  been  in  quarantine,-  which,  of  course,  acoounted  for  the  condition  in  which  I  found  her.

Portholes  again  tfTT  j  dinner,  then  a  brief  interview  with  the  chief  steward,  whoso  questions  elicited  the  facts  that  I  h»dJ  no  discharge  and  did  not  belong  to  the  Union.  He  was:  sorry  —  at  least,  he  said_  ho  was  —  but  he  oould  not  let  me  sign   'on,  so,  with  a  few  shillings  for  my  morn  ing's  work,  I  went'  ashore  again  to'  look  for  employment.  I  have  since  shrewdly  sus  pected  that  there  was  really  no  vacancy  -for  a  steward,  at  all,  but  that  -the  chief  wanted  those  portholes  cleaned,  and  ?  was  either  afraid  or  ashamed  to  ask/his  staff  to  do  them.  But  I  was  gaining'  experience,  and  that  night.  I  slept  in  a  bed.  '  Things  were  soon  'only  middling'  again,  and  my  belt  required  taking  in  a  hole  every  morning-  when  T  fortunately,  and  accidentally,  dropped  across  a  friend  of  the  family,  who  was  doing  well  with  ,  his  brush  and  pencil  ;  in  fact,  it  was  his  cartoon  of  Beach,  who  had  just  beaten  Hanlan  for  the  second:  time  that  led  to  our  meeting,  for  copies  of  the  picture  were  being  advertised  for  sale  —  ap-  ply  'C.  Penstone,  Cambridge  Club  Hotel.'  I  saw  the  ad.  in  the  morning  and  Penstone  in  the  afternoon.  An  introduction  'by  him  to  the  proprietor  of  a  -variety  entertainment  then  running  in  Sydney  led  to  my  writing  a  musical  sketch  on  the  return  of  the  Sou  dan  Contingent,  and,  later,  to  an  engage  ment  as  'corner  man'  with  the  'Soudan  Minstrels,'  a  company  composed  partly  of  returned  warriors  and  partly  of  profession  als,  of  whom  I  was  regarded  as  one.  As  an  amateur,  at  home,  I  had  frequently  dis  guised  my  features  with  a  layer  of  burnt  cork,  and  now,  having  shaved  my  upper  lip  aind  rehearsed  with  tho  company,  I  certainly  did  consider  myself  a  full-blown  actor.  We  opened  to  'a  beggarly  array  of  empty  benches'  at  the  Victoria  Theatre,  Parra  matta;  we  played  two  nights  at  Wallsend,  two  at  Minmi,  one'  at  Lambton,  -and  then  went  bung.  It  was  a  fine  moonlight  night  when  we  walked  to  Newcastle  and  caught  the  boat  for  Sydney;  but  as  I  had  no  money  left  for  tram  fare  next  morning,  it  was  distinctly  disappointing,  not  :to  say  distress  ing,  after  humping  .a  heavy  portmanteau  from  Sussex-street  to  the  house  I  had  left  at  Waverley,  to  find  'To  Let'  in  the  win  dow  !  Martyn  Hagan  will  doubtless  remem  ber  the  tour  of  the  'Soudan  Minstrels.'  Personally,  I  shall  never  forget  it.  I  re-'  turned  to  Wallsend  a  few  months  after  ward,  and  got  work  in  the  Co-operative  Colliery,  Plattsburg,  on  the  timber,  and  was  not  there  many  days  before  I  distinguished  myself  by  cutting  my  head  open  witE  the   ?  -  n  coal  roof.  I  had  seen  the  -boys  standing  on  the  buffers  of  skips,  and  as  X  had  to  wheel  an  empty  skip  back  to  tne  shaft  after  a  full  one  had  been  taken  away,  witli  a  horse,  by  my  mate,  I  thought  I  might  as  well  ride  back  as  walk,  for  it  was  down  hill.  I  sup  nose  I  did  stand  on  the  buffers,  ?  but  all  I   remembered  was  a  violent  earthquake,  a  grand  firework  display,  a  skip  overturned,  and  blood  trickling  down  my  face  as  I  sat  in  the  dark  on  the  ground.  I  walked  back  with  the  empties  after  that.  I  worked  a  few  months  at  the  colliery,  then,  with  many  others,  was  put  off,  owing  to  slackness  of  trade.  This  was  followed  by  a  short  stay  in  Newcastle,  where  I  did  a  little  scribbling  and  a  little  timber-tallying.  Then  back  to  Sydney  again,  and  another  hunt  for  the  elusive  billet.  All  this  happened  twenty  years  ago,  and  what  have  I  not  been  since  then?

"Immigrant  Labourers.   The.  arrival  ot  a  batch  of  working  men  from  southward  in  ""Queensland,  in  search  of  work,'  has  raised  two  or  three  ques  tions,  beside  that  of  finding  work  lor  these  men.'  It  seems  that  they  caime  on  their  own  account.  that  no  one   sent  them,  or  '  sent  for  them.  Then,'  why  did  'they  leave  their  former  place  of  residence  ?  We  must  assume  that  they  found  themselves  in  a  wilderness,  and  that  they  marched  to  Queensland  as  a  land  of  promise.  What  is  the  matter  with  industries  down  south?  Is  there  no  employment  in  Victoria,  or  in  New  South  Wales  ?  Federal  and  State  money,  in  millions  is  being  spent  down  that  way.  Even  it  most  of  it  is  holing  spent  in  official  life,  there  should  be  in  dustrial  employment,  for  someone  must  grow  or  produce  the  food  for  this  great  official  army,  all  of  whose  members  also  must  he  well  clothed'.  Occasionally  some  of  the  Ministers  arc  arrayed  like  Solo  mon  in  all  his  glory.  Ierlinps-  all  of  the  land  in  Victoria  has  been  taken  up  by  persons  who  can  do  Mieir  own  '  work  thcrcuu.  As  to  trades,  in  Mel-bourne  itself,  thev  must  he  sulfering  not  a  little  in  spite  of  protection.  Melbourne  is  lie-  coming  the  great  port  for  oversea  trade.  In  the  circumstances  it  is  very  likely  that  local  industries  arc  somewhat  dis-  courugcd,  so  that  a  good  many  workers  must  go  elsewhere  for  employment.  Dur  ing  the  past  few  months  so  much  has  been  said  about  the  resources  and  pros  pects  of  Queensland,  that  individuals  at  a  distance,  havo  been  captivated.  So  far  back  in  time  as  February  in  last  year,  our  Premier  in  office  closed  bis  political  manifesto  in  the  words  of  a  great  orator,  by  assuring  his  hearers  and  readers  that  under  ills  administration  of  public  affairs  litis  country  would  cuter  on  a  period  of  prosperity  the  like  of  which  never  before  had  been  witnessed  in  our  history.  From  that  time  to  this,  as  occasion  oilcrcd,  Mr.  Kidston  has  told  mankind  in  general,  aad  Australia  in  particular,-  that  Queensland  is  in  sooth-  the'  promised  land..  Therefore  we  should  not  lie  surprised  If  at  least  a  few  persons  have  suffered  an  elevation  '  of  their,  hopes  and  expectations,  lo  be  wo-  iully  disappointed  on  their  coming  to  this  country.  Further,  it  may  be  inquired  as  to  how  these  wild  and  exaggerated  statements  fit  in  with  what  seriously  is  taken  to  be  the  'immigration  policy  ot  the  present  Government.  In  his  Rockhampton  mani  festo  Mr.  .  Kidston  promised  what  lie  called  a  ""hold  immigration  policy.""  What  is  tho  meaning  of  the  term  ""hold""  in  that  expression  ?  As  it  may  servo  the  pur  poses  of  two  very  different  classes  of  in  dividuals,  a  hold  immigration  may  signify  the  introduction  of  wngo  earners,  or  it  nidv  signify  tho  introduction  ot  men  with  some  capital  to  settle  on  the  land.  No  one  -of  -  the  openmouthed  individu  als  crying  for  '  the  immigration  of  millions  -of  persons  into  this  country,  lias  ever  suggested  whence  must  come  tho  capital  for  their  employment.  When  reduced  to  a  practical  form,  the  employee  implies  .the  employer.  The  latter  has  capital  in  his  pocket  j  the  former  has  .'capital  in  his  sinews.  But  if  the  employer  is  not  here,  what  shall  'wo  .  do  with  tho  wage'  earner?  '  Ilonco  it  follows  that  tho  introduction  of  waiSe  earners  iiiiplies  the  presence  of  persons  forming  a  class  against  which  .  the  .Socialist  politi  cian  is'  always  using  tho  best  words.  He  exhausts  his  vocabulary  in  denouncing  capital,  and  Jhcrcforo  in  denouncing  em-  '  ""  ploycrs.  His  hand  is  against  them,  al  though,  too  frequently,  ho  would  gladly  put  Iris  hand  in  their  pockets,  ,  and  take  out  their  money  to  turn  himself  Into  tbo  hated  capitalist.  Lot  us  ,  sajj  if  -  wo  are  willing  to  bring  into  this  country  a'  nutn-  hcr  of  men  and  women  whose  only  capital  a  -  their  sinews.  If  wo'/say  l  ,yes..  -thon.  also  mudt  wo  say  who  is  to  find  work-for;   '  them.  On  the  statements  made,  wo  now  lAivc  in  our  midst  a  small  contingolit  of-  wage  earners  for.,  whom  no  employment;  can  he  found.  And,  by  the'  ""way,  why  '  should  tho  department  exert  itself  to-  find  employment  for  these  strangers,'  itacahV  while  to  lioukc  and  to  feed  them,  when  unemployed  men  previously  in  our  midst  have  .  to  house  and  :  feed.  .  ,lhem-;  selves  if  they  can,  or  to  do  the  other  thing  ?  This  brings  us-tc  another,  question/  If  this  ""liotd""  immigration  policy  is  to'  (  favour  the  incoming  of  men  wi-tli  a  small;  amount  of  capital,  the  Question  is,  hoW  are  we  to  .  get  hold  of  men  of  that  class  \  If  they  are  in  southern  Stages,  why  do  they  not  come  here  ?  Because  they  ard  well  enough  off  where-  they  are.  Mf-.tbey  are  in  European  countries,  why  do  they  not  come  here?  Because  they  fear;  that  they  i/iuld  not  better  themselves'.':  Tho  business  af  setting  up  a  ""hold""  im-|  migration  policy  appears  to  be  merely  hustings  talk.
